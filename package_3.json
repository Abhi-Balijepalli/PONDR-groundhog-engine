It's easy to set up on your phone and it gives you so much information every day.  It's ideal for those trying to lose weight because sometimes your weight doesn't change, but other numbers do change.  It gives me a feeling of accomplishment when my water intake improves or when my BMI gets better.  It also helps me because I'm lifting weight as part of my weight loss program and it shows my muscle mass.  I've shown several friends this scale and they've stepped on mine...  and every single one of them stops immediately and goes onto Amazon to buy this scale before I've even told them all about it.  If you are hesitant whether or not to get this scale, don't be.  This scale is awesome!  NO REGRETS!  (as far as accuracy, I have no idea.  The weight portion is dead on accurate with my doctor's scale.  I don't know if the other data is 100% perfectly on-point, but it's a good gauge of where you can improve and what you need to work on.  It's valuable information.

I was wondering if the scale's software memorized the previous weight measured and just repeated that value if the new measurement was within a small margin. So, I did a little test using weights from my weight bench.  I weighed my weights and then myself multiple consecutive times, each time I stepped on holding a different combo of 5 to 25 pounds.  It did report within .2 to .4 pounds of what it should have been, which IMHO is pretty reasonable (it only reports in .2 increments).

It even seems to transmit data sometimes without opening the app. Every now and then, it seems that I have to open the app or repeat the measurement to get it communicate. Again, no biggie. One note here about multiple users. Because I have 4 different users on the scale, some of which have similar weight (+/- 15 lbs) , the app will often ask you which user the measurement is for.

Just for fun, I also shifted around on it too, but thankfully it didn't fluctuate as long as I kept both feet on the scale. I try it every morning after I wake up, and every night before I go to sleep... I did this for about two weeks to test its accuracy and how much it fluctuated (I don't do it as much now because it does make me a bit anxious seeing my weight go up and down). The weight was steadily consistent, alternating based on my diet or workouts. I have tried it with socks or shoes on, and each time it refused to weigh me which I appreciate as it does go along with what Arboleaf claims (on how it weights a person). Accuracy/Changes:::: Something I found interesting is how seemingly accurate (I'm still skeptical) it is with not only measuring body weight but also muscle mass, water, and etc. One day I have bumped up a pound, but some of my stats decreased which either displayed me gaining a pound in muscle or in water while my body fat remained the same. Additionally, I have seen my water and muscle weight change based on what I do that day. Bluetooth:::: It connects quickly to my cellphone (it will let you know if it cannot connect to Bluetooth, as the Bluetooth icon will not appear on the scale's face) which is a nice bonus. Any Problems/Throughout Use:::: I've had it for a month or so now without any problems (my apartment is kept between 60-75 degrees, and I usually keep it in my kitchen).

Clear intuitive data readouts featuring a robust set of body composition indicators (e.g., weight, BMI, body fat, body water, muscle mass, metabolic age and several other indicators).  A visual readout of where you currently stand relative to the desirable norm in any given body composition area.  In weight, for example, you will immediately see where your number lands on a range from underweight, to normal to overweight to \"obese.\"  Similarly you will see whether your visceral fat is good, acceptable, high or excessive  and so on with all the other body composition indicators.  Easy progress tracking - Clear graphs illustrating, increases or decreases (week-to-week, month-to-month or year-to-year) within each of those body composition indicators. All of this together produces an incredible immediacy of impact.  In other words, seeing your progress (or lack thereof) in each of these areas is a powerful motivator to action.

I thought it was just another email full of empty promises from a desperate manufacturer, so i said SURE! Why not?! Send them to me. Not even three days later, i received a package with a new scale that has connected to my phone beautifully every time. Will it last? Time will tell. I also received the email with a code for a 45 Amazon credit. I am very impressed by the customer service, especially since it's been two years since my initial purchase. The follow up is extraordinary. Most importantly, the scale i wanted now functions exactly the way it's supposed to, so it seems they really do listen to their customer reviews.

I like that when the scale is not in use, the measurement disappears. When activated, the scale screen reading glows through the opaque looking white platform and is easy to read. It looks much better than the first photograph image on the product page. I use the iPhone app which was easy to install. Under the \"My Account\" It has tabs/buttons for FAQs, Add a User, and also Settings that allow the user to customize options and set a weight goal, select weight units and connect to other health apps and devices. On the \"Measurement\" page, It gives the user access too many different kinds of data and tracks the progress from the first weigh in. On the \"History\" page the data is charted by the week, month, or year. The scale will remember 20 uses and upload it to the Arboleaf app when it is opened. At this point it doesn't seem to sort the information per email address or other identifying means, but relies on the user to identify the measurements belong to them.  My husband and I both use the scale and as multi-users, it was a little confusing at first when we did not open the app before measurement. My husband did not want to have his phone with him when he weighed himself and he did not want to select the measurements that belonged to him when he opened his Arboleaf app. I decided that it would solve the problem if I always had the app opened when I weighed myself so that the scale did not need to store my data. That seems to be a solution but I am hoping that Arboleaf will update the app and improve that feature. I have other devices that regularly improve the function of their product through updates and I am hoping and expecting this company will also.

It is exactly what I wanted in regards to blue tooth, nice app, data recorded, and ease of use. And I should say that the scale I received was great! No issues with the quality or functionality. However, I did want the scale to track fat mass progress better. Let me clarify; I have used a Tanita body fat scale since 2004. The same one! It has been my tried and true and tracks body fat perfectly with my fat pinchers. I have been as high as 17-18% and as low as 4-5% body fat on the tanita scale as I have gone from ripped to huge. That scale tracks well. However, this Arboleaf scale does not seem to come anywhere close to measuring my body fat accurately. Now let me state I dont care where my base line fat is really. Im looking to track progress. I started using the scale about 2 months ago and I was 212 lbs and 18% fat on the arboleaf and 212lbs and 16% fat on the tanita. Then I started training 5 days a week on a calorie restricted diet that consisted of high protein and fat. As the weeks wore on the arboleaf measured me as 17.6-18.3% body fat. This couldnt be correct. 6 weeks into training I have lost 16lbs and measure 9.7% body fat on my tanita scale. Plus I can still deadlift My normal 500lbs so I havent really lost all that much muscle. Anyway, I just feel like the Arboleaf scale doesnt really track progress well and uses some type of stored numbers based on age, weight, height, and some resistance measurement. If they can improve and use a real measurement I would recommend to everyone. However, for fat tracking I dont recommend.

But if you are doing work-around, as I did, with creating a new user for Arboleaf, the app randomly chose which profile the data belonged by itself *if two phones are around* the scale. I do not see any way to fix that. I hoped one of the solutions might be to reassign data to other profile like it is done with Nokia/Withings scales for example but unfortunately this is not the case, and the only solution is to delete the data. 3) Technical support hasn't responded so far for 3 weeks for the problem so far.

I've tried a different scale before (Enerplex Scale) and I liked it, but the app was so glitchy, so that was why I didn't buy it. So I researched and it boiled down to this and FITINDEX's smart scale. After reading articles, and seeing the ratings and reviews, I chose this scale. I love this scale so much, it feels as good of quality as the Taylor digital scale that's at my mother's house - which is very accurate by the way. I compared the results of the weight between this scale and the Taylor scale - and they both said the same thing. As for the other stuff, I don't know if it's accurate, but that's why I researched about how accurate it is. I will say that the coolest thing about this scale that I didn't notice others scale have is the \"Body Type\" category. This category takes into account the fact that a high BMI does NOT always mean you're unhealthy and overweight. It takes into account your body fat percentage, combined with your BMI, to then deduce whether you're overweight, heavy, or actually fit and healthy. I love that my boyfriend doesn't have to make an account because he couldn't be bothered to make one, and instead I can just manage his account for him with mine. I've already told a good friend of mine about this scale and my cousin - they both plan on buying it now as well! Also, it makes a cute sound whenever you lose more than like, maybe 3 or 5 pounds.

After I originally thought I had a defective scale, that turned out to be package of bad batteries (even though they were \"new\" and in original packaging), when I contact Arboleaf they were promptly ready to make it right without question. I bought this scale in September 2019 and it worked great until the batteries began to run low. It displayed \"Lo\" when stepping on the scale for a few days, but I wasn't in any rush to replace them and they eventually completely died. When I finally did replace the batteries about a week later the scale would not turn back on. I tried multiple brand new batteries, confirming very carefully each battery was placed in the correct orientation but no success. I did not at the time realize a few of the batteries in the package had leaked and corroded and most likely infecting neighboring batteries. Naturally I was disappointed to think the scale was defective after less than 6 months, but I simply contacted Arboleaf customer service by email asking if the unit was still in warranty and expecting I would have to go through some troubleshooting or RMA process. I was pleasantly surprised by the superb customer service. and the only response I received from customer service was an apology for the inconvenience, and we have shipped you a new scale that you can expect to receive it 8-10 days. I actually received the replacement in only 2 days, but was not until after I received the replacement scale that--out of curiosity--I discovered the issue with MY batteries by swapping batteries back and forth between the two scales. So now I have dilemma where I need to pay for the replacement that I unintentionally received Despite my error, Arboleaf has both instilled confidence in their product and in their customer service.

I bought a much more expensive one from Vanity Planet and based on my history using hydrostatic bodyfat tests (one of the most accurate ways of measuring body composition - I pay $40 per measurement), its much closer to being accurate. Not accurate at all for measuring body fat or anything other than total weight. It measures clear and obvious changes in day-to-day water weight as changes in fat and muscle mass. For example, Im a pound lighter today than I was yesterday and it calculated that as my body fat going down by 4 tenths of a percent and losing a pound of muscle! Overnight!  - Folks, thats scientifically impossible if you know anything about fat and muscle loss/gain, and these are the kind of changes it shows every day.

SUPER simple to use. Open the app and step on the scale. You only have to be sure your Bluetooth is on (you dont have to pair it or anything like that) so the two can speak to each other. 2. It automatically saves everything in the app, so you have a complete history as far back as day one. 3. The metrics are amazing. I have lost 10 lbs since buying the scale JUST because I was aghast to see where my numbers fell! Ill give you an example: I had never seen my body fat percentage before. Im pretty average height and weight, not someone normally worried, but my body fat percentage fell into obese! Yegads!! We have Type 2 diabetes running through my family, so I definitely dont want that! Visceral fat (fat around the middle) is another figure that matters for diabetes, so I have been able to get that down, too, just by paying attention.

It is a \"smart\" scale and is extremely accurate as far as measuring weight and body fat percentages. However, this one is light years ahead of my last one, as far as technology goes. It pairs with a fitness app that I use with my cell phone to track my weight and body fat progress. It even syncs my data with my Fitbit app, so I don't have to enter my weight and body fat percentage. All I have to do is step on the scale and my weight and body fat percentage automatically appear on my app. This scale measures so much more than weight and body fat percentage. It also includes data such as body water percentage, muscle mass, bone mass and metabolic age. Using the corresponding Arboleaf app, it also shows me graphs to track my progress to get me to my weight loss goals. The best part of this scale is that it can also track everyone in my family separately. The scale is smart enough to know, based on historical data, who is stepping on the scale and where to track it. For example, when my husband steps on the scale, the information from the scale appears on his Google Fit app magically. All in all, this is a great scale.

To give a little bit of background, I had just recently had Bariatric surgery so the weight's coming off quickly and I wanted to ensure the numbers weren't wildly off. But, they've been pretty spot on. To explain my routine with this, the scale sits up on the wall in my bathroom (small bathroom so no place to just let it on the floor all the time). The bathroom floor is tile so no carpet issues to be concerned with. I take the scale, set it on the floor in the same spot, apply some pressure and then step off to get it turned on and allow it to calibrate, and once it reads zero, I get on and let it do its thing. So up to this point, all was great! But then I wanted to get the app involved to take advantage of all the scale had to offer. It was a little tricky getting it to pair at first but I did get it. However, for the first week or so, I always struggled to get it to communicate with the phone so that it could input my info into the app. I thought distance might be a problem so I tried holding it close to the scale but that didn't help. Eventually, I would get it after playing around but couldn't figure out why this was so difficult to connect up all the time. I read through the instructions and they don't specifically state how to get the two devices to communicate every time. They only explain how to get the scale paired to the phone for the first time. SO, this is what you need to do. 1. MOST IMPORTANT! Do NOT have the App opened on your phone BEFORE stepping on the scale! Doing so leads you down the rabbit hole of \"Why won't these two things talk to each other?!\" 2. Go through the initial steps I described above (get the scale turned on and calibrated). 3. While the scale is working on getting calibrated, open your app on your phone. 4. Step on the scale, and everything works perfectly as intended! So, other than this minor inconvenience, the scale works great, the app is FULL of information that has helped me track not just my weight loss but WHERE that loss is coming from (muscle loss, fat loss, bone loss). I LOVE the historical data and the fact it keeps track of my loss on a daily basis from the first day I started recording the info in the app. I would highly recommend it to anyone but I will definitely be trying to ease their connectivity frustration by explaining the steps above."}, {"date": "2019-02-16", "score": 0.946, "review": "I really like the scale itself.

If I select Yes, the results of the Body Composition Model are drastically different than if I select No. Perhaps there should be a few more settings around body type and health to more accurately configure the model.

After doing my own research, I chose the Bluetooth Body Fat Scale - Smart Scale Wireless Bathroom Weight Scale from Arboleaf and I'm extremely pleased - it just works, and works great! Both my wife and I use it and it easily recognizes which of us is on it (via the app).  Connecting to the app required no jumping through hoops to detect and connect a Bluetooth device - it just finds it when I step on the scale.  I've been using it consistently for 1.5 months and have had no issues whatsoever.  I've uploaded pics of the app itself as that wasn't so easy to find when I was doing my research.  These show you exactly what the scale can measure and track (and give you indications of where you fall on the spectrum for each measurement based on the profile data you enter in the app). Lastly, I'm a Samsung Note 8 user and use Samsung Health to track my exercise and now weight.  While there is no direct link to the Arboleaf app, you can get your weight data into Samsung Health via Google Fit.  Note: it sometimes takes a while (minutes or more) for the data to come across to Samsung Health which can be a little frustrating at first, but just leave all the apps open for a while and they'll eventually get synced.

When I bought it, I was so excited at the data it was telling me! It said I was fit, had 120 lbs of muscle mass, and was 18% body fat. Woohoo! Then I went to the gym and had a session with a trainer. She put me on the fancy machine where the current goes through not only the lower half of your body but your upper as well by holding on to 2 sensors. Turns out I am 27% body fat!!! And had only 90 lbs of muscle mass. So aside from my actual weight being accurate on the arboleaf scale, I don't trust the information at all.  Complete waste of money. Very misleading."}, {"date": "2019-05-31", "score": 0.758, "review": "I love the ease of using the app. I step on the scale and in seconds I know my weight.

This one turns on, on touch, and seems to be reading consistently. Thanks so much for the hasty resolve! For all the positives i found with this scale, plus the fact that it seems accurate now, I would highly recommend. Seems I just had a faulty model. Cliff notes: Great mobile app and nice looking scale, but it gets 2 stars because it's wildly inaccurate at measuring weight (which is of course the most important feature of a scale) and is really hard to turn on (lightly tapping does not work). I've tried other smart scales, so know how one of these should behave. Here I'll go into more details. First the good: 1) The mobile app is great, and it provides a plethora of longitudinal information, more than my previous scale and it's great that it automatically syncs to the arboleaf app and IOS health app. It can also tell when someone who weighs significantly different than me isn't me, so their data doesn't get stored on my profile 2) It's an attractive scale Reason for 2 stars: 1) It's wildly inaccurate. This has been an issue since day 1, but i never got around to contacting them about this and am probably too late at this point. I currently weigh 200 lbs. Today, for example, the scale first told me I weighed 185, then I tried again and it said 191. Then I tried a third time and it said 181. I waited a few hours later for good measure and it finally said 199 (which I assume is correct). It's so inconsistent, I never know what I'm going to get. Sometimes I can't even get it to zero out before I step on the scale. For context, I'm using it on a hardwood floor. 2) It says \"tap\" to turn on, then wait for it to zero out, then step on the scale...but I've never once been able to just \"tap\" the scale to turn it on. There isn't a sweet spot either. I have to press my foot somewhat hard and put my weight into it several times for it to turn on. 3) When you weigh yourself, all it shows on the scale is your weight. It would be nice if it showed your body makeup as well (fat %, water %, etc.) on screen like many other smart scales do, but you have to log into the mobile app to see these details. Summary: I'd probably look elsewhere if I were you. I've tried taking out the batteries and putting them back in, but nothing seems to fix it. Maybe I got a faulty one, but if not, this scale should be a pass for future buyers."}, {"date": "2019-06-05", "score": 0.994, "review": "Is it the perfect scale? No. But, from what I can tell it's the closest thing out on the market for my purposes. By my standards, a perfect scale would probably run 10 times the price, so this still would be better than that hypothetical perfect scale when considering value. I must say, it is extremely gratifying to see a graph of my weight loss over time. The other metrics are also interesting to look at, I can't vouch for their accuracy, and I'm sure most of them are primarily derived from the weight itself, they are still useful to give direction. It works as advertised and the app is well designed. My only slight complaint is that I often have to step on the scale a second or third time for the app to sync to the scale and collect the data, luckily it saves my completed data so I don't have to re-weight myself each time. It would be nice to be able to hook it up to a router for (non internet) communication over wifi, but I understand that such technology is not practical or cost effective for a rarely on, battery powered device. I believe this is more a case of my phone's Bluetooth not being optimally usable immediately after turning it on (since I only turn it on when I am going to use it), but it's still a minor annoyance. For reference I use a Nexus 6P on Android 8.1.0. The scale itself looks and feels nice, provides accurate weight measurements, and can handle my rather high weight (290 lbs at the start) without issue. I have used it daily for the past 3+ months.

It is a safe system that provides body composition metrics. I like monitoring my BMI, body fat and bone density. I synced my scale to the Arboleaf app and also synced it to my apple iphone health app.  I know that the bone density measurement is accurate because I had a DEXA scan which confirms the scale's accuracy.  I like getting on the scale every morning at the same time.  When I get on the scale I have my iphone nearby with the Arboleaf app open and I hear a big Bing sound which gives me the body composition results immediately. Its kind of addicting.  I am the kind of person that forms habits and this has become a definite habit.  Its a tool that gives me more information and it motivates me to set a weight goal.  One piece of information the scale provides is Metabolic age which I like to watch because I like to see that my metabolic age is below my actual age.  I like that each body composition metric is put into perspective so that I know if I am within the healthy range.  For example my body fat was 28% which is average but I now am motivated to see if I can lower it to the fitness range.  I highly recommend the Arboleaf bluetooth scale.

I've never kept a scale in my bathroom to track my weight, but decided I wanted something that would weigh me AND tell me my BMI. This one does all that and is accurate when I compared it to BMI measuring tools at the gym. It also measures  Body Fat %, Visceral Fat, Body Water, MuscleMass, Bone Mass, BMR, and shows your metabolic age. I admit that most of these things don't mean much to me, but it's nice to see them measured, so I can go back later and analyze things if I want to. I'd rather have too much info than not enough ;) It tracks all that and shows a history of all your weigh-ins, making it easy to see your progress over time. BEST PART - You open the Arboleaf app on your phone and it automatically syncs your data to the app. Which also syncs that data to the Apple Health app AND MyFitnessPal.

Then I found this one, which only needs to be connected to your phone via Bluetooth. I have an iPhone 11 Pro, and setup was super easy. There is an app that needs to be downloaded. It syncs with Apple Health, which the app wizard walks you through to make sure it only shares what you want to share. The scale is easy to use. Turn on by stepping on the scale, then stepping off before it measures your weight. The scale will calibrate, then display a zero when it's ready for you to step on. Step on the scale in your bare feet, making sure the balls and heels touch the metal parts. Count to 6 or so, then look down to make sure it has finished measuring. Step off. This procedure doesn't sync the data to your phone. The scale will store up to 20 measurements between syncs. In order to sync the data from the scale to your phone, you need to open the app on your phone and turn on the scale. The app will show you the different measurements and let you pick which ones to apply to your profile (in the event that there are multiple users). One issue I have is that there isn't a beep when it's done with its measurements. My other scale will beep once when it's ready for me to step on, then beep twice when it's ok for me to step off. I wish this one would at least beep when it's ok to step off. The LED numbers are large and bright and easy to read. As far as I know, only weight can be seen from the scale itself. I don't know how accurate the scale is. However, it is precise, meaning it will give me the exact same measurement if I weigh myself, let it turn off, then weigh myself again. I have two other scales that report lower weights. Those two scales are always within one pound of each other. This scale is almost 2 lbs more than one and 3 lbs more than the other. This difference is pretty consistent. I trust the middle scale the most. But, I don't care if this scale adds a couple of pounds to my true weight. I will keep using it because I like the fact that it records my weights to the app and Apple Health. There are several items that this scale claims to measure, some of which I skeptical of. For example, bone mass. This scale puts me smack dab in the middle. Almost no one will legitimately be smack dab in the middle, and knowing how large my wrists and shoulders were when I was skinny, I doubt I have average sized bones. BMI is useless in my opinion because it is nothing more than a bunch of abracadabra applied to your weight and height. If your weight and height are recorded, there's no need for BMI. The metabolic age is another one I could do without. It doesn't really tell me how healthy I am because it basically just uses your weight, height, and age to come up with a number. The main take away from this is not to rely on any of the numbers this scale reports. If any of these items are important to you, go to a professional to have them accurately measured.

Id probably waste less in the long run if I just threw the scale in the trash now, even though it works well. Its absolute bullish!+"}, {"date": "2021-02-04", "score": 0.465, "review": "I am convinced that this item is so well like due to inaccuracies, the customers are dilusional and enjoy the feedback. There is no way my body fat is 10%, that would never be healthy for a middle aged female. At this point I probably fall around 23%. That is the only metric I wanted to trend so for me this scale is useless. I also find the weight to be off. When I first stepped on the scale last night I was 126.8 probably accurate, an hour later it stopped to 124.6 and this morning I was 121.8.

This happened twice, I thought maybe the new batteries I gave it the first time may have been accidentally used before and had gotten put back in the drawer. Nope, the second time was batteries right out of the package. Still dead within days. But I'm going to be EXTREMELY upset losing my past 3mo of records if I go with a different scale now, so idk what to do. Old review: So far I am really enjoying this scale. The app is easy to use, I haven't had any trouble pairing it with my note 9. I am giving the accuracy 4 stars because it always weighs me 2lbs heavier than the other digital scale I already have, and from way back when I last went to the Dr I *think* that scale in the office already weighed me lighter than my existing scale, which would make this one more like 3 or 4lbs off. But, I will actually be going to the Dr in a few more weeks, so I'll be sure to weigh myself the morning of to see how it compares to the Dr's scale, and then will come back and update this review. ALSO: I always feel it should be noted when a product that has a particularly large number of high Amazon reviews happens to come with any sort of promotional incentive  in the packaging, encouraging people to review them. My box included such a flyer, saying they would send me a free food scale if I send them an email with a screenshot of my review. I will be doing so, and I would certainly put the food scale to frequent use, but I feel this is something that should be disclosed to all potential buyers currently skimming the massive amounts of reviews. And worst case scenario, should they not send me a scale because I included this information in my review, I'll be sprinting back here to say so!"}, {"date": "2021-03-17", "score": 0.511, "review": "I like the scale the app is great but it weighs about 10 pounds heavier and I can't get it to calibrate.

Very happy."}, {"date": "2021-04-07", "score": -0.725, "review": "The Good: Setup and connection are super easy with a current Android phone & updated OS.  Just a few minutes to enter name, height, other data, and complete app connection & setup.  Could not be easier. Weight and BMI reading seems to be accurate (checked against other scales).  It is nice to have a record with chart.  I am 20 days into a Dr. Fung style extended fast.  It is nice and motivating to see a line chart which is mostly down. There are at least 2 users with individual sets of records.  That is nice. The Bad: Security seems lacking.  The app requires both an email and password.  That is completely unnecessary for an app which only communicates between one smart phone/device and one smart scale.  Is this data going to be passed to the Arboleaf manufacturer, or CCP??  Reading the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy gives me zero confidence or trust. Bluetooth pairing is a second security problem.  Normal pairing requires human approval by the OS before pairing is allowed.  How did these guys manage to bypass that normal security step?? Given these obvious security violations, I wonder what else this app will do.  Could it scrape my phone and send the data to China?  It should have no ability to access the internet, but I do not trust this app, or updates to the app.  I have checked Android permissions and found no problems.  I have also looked for a welcome email and found none.  So maybe the security issues are smaller than I imagine. The body composition numbers are pure BS.  Weight is simply taken from the scale, and BMI is a math calculation when the height is known.  The other measurements seem to be tied to weight / BMI rather than the electronic body scan.  At first, I did not know, but now I am sure.  After 20 days of working out, mostly strong ketone readings, falling weight, and girth, with increasing strength I know the Fat, and Muscle numbers are useless.  I know for sure that I have burned body fat and increased muscle mass.  Both of those numbers on the app/scale seem to have a direct linear relationship to weight.  The app has no clue what happened to my body fat & muscle.  Same for water.  A couple other measurement items are questionable, but I do not know for sure. A minor shortcoming is that the promo says the scale will remember a set of measurements till the next connection to the app.  Not true.  Also the promotion said the app will recognize and differentiate the person on the scale and make the entry for appropriate person/user.  Not true.  You must open the app, then open the appropriate person/user on the app, and then step on the scale.  If you open user 1 and have user 2 step on the scale, you will get an error that you seem too fat/thin vs. the last record. The Ugly: Bad numbers are worse than no numbers.  The body composition numbers are completely bogus.  Arboleaf has no clue.  Better off with a tape measure and calipers, and watch those manually. Bottom Line: Returning to Amazon."}, {"date": "2021-04-08", "score": 0.103, "review": "The scale works fine, but the app is judgemental.

Two things that can be improved: 1) battery life. I used mine for about 3 months when I got the Lo Bat. message and had to replace the 3x AAA batteries. Maybe I'm being too picky, but I expected to get a little more life with the my use...no big deal! 2) The communication between the scale and the app on my phone is very good. It even seems to transmit data sometimes without opening the app. Every now and then, it seems that I have to open the app or repeat the measurement to get it communicate. Again, no biggie. One note here about multiple users. Because I have 4 different users on the scale, some of which have similar weight (+/- 15 lbs) , the app will often ask you which user the measurement is for. Perhaps this can be improved in looking at the overall user profile data and making matching the data with the user more seamless. Like I said, I'm being picky! One final note.
