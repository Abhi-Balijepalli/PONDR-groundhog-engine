I had to use my knuckles to get the red button pushed, and they were getting rubbed raw. I knew there had to be a solution so I searched online and found this tool. I was skeptical, but having longer nails this past year is one of the few things that kept me feeling like the world was normal. Anyway, I can't believe I struggled for months before searching for something like this. It changed my life - seriously - some days I didn't know if I was going to get the kids out of their seats at all (tears were involved on numerous occasions). This little tool does exactly what it says with almost NO pressure needed AT ALL. Less pressure than it takes to turn the volume up on your cell phone, or type out a review on a keyboard. Highly recommend it for women with nails or anyone who has hand/finger issues. I bought another one for my mom who has arthritis. Get this, mom's/dad's/grandparents/caretakers!!!!!"}, {"date": "2021-04-12", "score": 0.662, "review": "This has made my life so much easier with my long nails.

I love my long nails and they make me feel girly and that shouldnt keep me from doing things for my two boys especially something as easy as getting them out of their car seats.
