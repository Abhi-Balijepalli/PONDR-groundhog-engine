Otherwise, probably not. I was super excited to get the UnBuckle Me for our daughter to use right away on our Christmas road trip, and she did, but now she never uses it. \"Can't teach an old dog new tricks\".  For it to be most effective there is a SLIGHT learning curve, and she wants it to work her way or no way. It will release the buckle...at least one side...if you place it correctly and just press against their body, but it works best & releases both buckles if you hold the device front & back, then squeeze.  So it doesn't reduce the work to unbuckle, but does reduce the required force.  She figures she'll just keep using her fingers instead of an additional, slightly cumbersome device. If she were using it, the durability of plastic in our cold ND winters is a concern.
