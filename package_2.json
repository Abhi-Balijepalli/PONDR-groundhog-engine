Seeing the price I was a little sceptical about the ANC in them and assumed the sound would be bad or the ANC not too strong. I was very wrong. Sound quality is balanced and has really good stereo separation between L & R channels and the bass is clean and not too overpowering. A little more low end would be nice but generally it's a pleasant listen. The mods and highs are well balanced and overall you get a fairly rich sound at this price point and even at some headphones much higher priced. Sound wise the only negative is overall volume, its not too low but a little boost higher would be better. The ANC has three modes. On, Off and Ambient. The difference between On & Off is subtle but it's there. The cups do a good job of blocking external noise anyway but you can hear the ANC working when there's no music playing and when it's on, you get very good isolation. The ambient mode works great to allow you to hear what is happening through the music and it works well. There's a very small delay on sounds but its only very slight. The headphones themselves are a little smaller than expected so they're quite tight on my head or around the neck, but not uncomfortably so and the ear cups are soft so do a good job of cushioning your ears when on The only annoying thing here is that they use micro USB to charge! Come on, it's 2020, just use USB C!!! All around I'm very impressed and they do a much better job than I anticipated.

They came delivered nicely packaged in a well-presented retail box and along with the headphones you get a travel pouch, charge cable, 3.5mm AUX cable, airplane adapter, and the user guide. Im pleased with the quality of them, the plastic feels strong and durable, they arent too lightweight that they feel cheap, the ear cups and headband are very soft and comfortable, and they generally look nice when your wearing them. The headphones are comfortable to wear and grip your head quite tightly, so they wont be falling off if you decide to go for a run with them. Pairing them with my Galaxy S20+ was simple and they were up and running in seconds. The sound quality is very good and Im quite impressed with them to be honest, the sound is clear, well-balanced and you get a nice amount of bass from them. I would like them to be a bit louder when in Bluetooth mode, but the max volume is fine when using the wired connection and it seems to be an issue most BT headphones suffer with anyway. Call quality while using them is good, I can hear the person clearly and they can hear me with no issues. Without them even being switched on they do a great job of insulating sound from the outside and when you turn the ANC on you can barely hear any external noise at all. Im working from home at the moment but I have a fan heater which you can still hear while wearing the headphones until the moment you turn ANC on and the noise disappears, very impressive to be honest! The ambient mode also works well as it uses the mic to let you hear external sounds and you get a slight amplification so you can actually hear a bit better while wearing them. Overall, for around 60 I think these headphones are a great purchase and good value for money. The sound quality is great, battery life excellent, they are comfortable, and you get a good quality travel pouch with them which is a nice addition.

Bass is good if you like it loud and heavy over hearing some of the detail and, yes, treble is present though a little weaker but it most definitely loses a little in the middle that prevents the music from coming alive if you're used to much more expensive sets.  That said, with these 3 to 5 times cheaper, they're perfectly good for a daily commute or just to sit around and listen to music. The build quality, however, is good with a nice drawstring bag and decent folding action these headphones are ideal to carry around.  The battery seems to last ages, too, on a single charge and the noise cancelling isn't bad for the price (just don't expect miracles), it's a little fiddly with a single button turning on and off the noise cancelling and the ambient sound.  Standard forward/backward buttons double as volume up/down with a power and pairing button in the centre of them.  There's an AUX in for wired connections (cable included) and charging is via Micro USB, sadly not USB C. The only negative about the build is for those with larger heads as these feel fairly tight, though perhaps better suited for teenagers wanting their first pair of decent wireless headphones. So, yes, they're pretty good for the price, it seems that these new cheaper brands have found a way to vastly improve quality over the last few years so most people will be happy with the quality of a set headphones like this without having to pay a fortune for it."}, {"date": "2020-10-31", "score": 0.987, "review": "Your browser does not support HTML5 video.

I found these very comfortable when on the head.  There is a reasonably good padded silicone inner headband which doesn't slide around and the speakers are also padded well and when I wore them with my glasses I didn't experience any discomfort.  I have small ears so they fitted nicely over them but if you are larger eared, you may find that instead of going over they kind of sit on and that may be a bit uncomfortable.  For me the buttons are the weak point.  They are functional but I found them to be rather \"plasticky\" and \"clicky\" and that scratchiness is transferred through the ear cup. Design-wise these look great and I love the black and red design with the flash of chrome/steel.  However if I could change anything, I would get rid of the phrases found on either side of the headband (I know, I know, I sound so old).  It's just as a middle aged family man, the \"Be Young\" and \"Be Free\" messaging falls rather flat... as I am neither. Lifting my spirits somewhat from that mid-life crisis realisation, I'm pleased to say that the sound quality on these is very good.  You get a good bass heavy soundscape.  Mids and Trebles are of course there, but I feel it definitely leans more to the bass. These also come with two sound modes.  First is ambient sound mode which lets in background noise and this works well.  When activated you can hear other people talking to you without having to remove the headphones. The second mode is the noise cancellation and I can report that this is good.  I tested it out with our bathroom's extractor fan running and when enabled, the rattly fan silenced to a quiet murmur.  On a plane these would definitely reduce that persistent hum. The speakers fold to make a smaller profile and there is a faux leather bag included to carry these around.  Also included are a 3.5 mm jack headphone cable and 2 prong 3.5 mm adaptor so that when on a plane these can be plugged into your phone or planes entertainment system.

Du coup cest une excellente configuration pour tester les performances  de ce  casque  Super EQ  rducteur de  bruit . Quelques mots d'abord sur  sa forme et son apparence . Son arceau est quip de deux charnires , tres pratique pour le plier et lui faire prendre un minimum de place . Comme il est en plus fourni avec un petit sac noir en ska , il ne prendra que peu de d'espace , dans un petit  sac  dos par exemple . Ses deux coussins circum-auriculaires  manquent un peu de consistance , il est encore neuf donc pour l'instant a va . L'espace pour les oreilles est un peu limit , pour les petites oreilles c'est OK , mais si comme le mchant loup vous en avez de grandes elles risquent de se retrouver un peu recroquevilles ,  avec risque d'inconfort .

Voil , maintenant la question , le mode rducteur de son efficace  ou pas ? Mon assainisseur d'air a trois vitesses , je le laisse toujours  la vitesse la plus faible , et donc avec le casque le bruit disparait compltement ,   la vitesse trois (tres bruyant )je l'entend mais le bruit est quand mme pas mal attnu . tant en possession du dernier casque Sony XM4   rducteur de bruit j'en ai profit pour comparer avec ce fleuron .  Le rsultat est qu'il n'a vraiment pas  rougir du tout de ses performances ! Par contre je pense avoir lev un livre , ou un lapinou  chacun de juger: A faible voir tres faible  volume , le Super EQ met un bruit rptitif , comme un grsillement  et uniquement du cot des commandes ,  droite , des que l'on monte le son on ne le peroit plus .

J'ai galement chang d'album de musique , rien n'y fait , ce bruit vient bien de l'intrieur de  l'oreillette droite . Il reste  savoir si c'est inhrent  mon exemplaire...

Memory foam earpads with leather cover. Impressions: Battery lasts me over a week, it's amazing! Built in Mic Works fine with my iPhone 11 Can connect to two devices simultaneously. The headband is very flexible and doesn't break easily. Earpads keep my ears warm on the inside, but don't steam me when indoors. Remarks: The bass levels aren't high at all! Ambient sound is ok, but active noise cancelling gives me a headache because i can almost hear a very high pitch tone blocking it. When outside or running you can hear a serious wind howl, which means the aerodynamics on the sides of each earphone needs to be improved. It's actually so loud that it begins to interfere with whatever I'm listening. My first impression with these SuperEQ S1 headphones was to the roof, however after using them for a month i noticed a few things began troubling me over time! The materials used are good quality, plastic headband has a long elastic region or i.e. they can be bent/deformed a lot without breaking and still return to the original shape. There is also a hinge on each earphone which allows it to move around 20 for better fit. The leather on the earphones is impressive the least as it's very soft and fully protects my ears ( i have big ears) from sound & cold weather. But when indoors my ears don't get steamed up. Battery is amazing, one charge takes around 90 minutes and then it lasts me over a week! Very impressive. Microphone isn't bad either, people say they can hear clear & loud when I'm connected to my iPhone 11, without hearing too much of the background noise. Music quality: Standard music and podcasts can be heard sharp and clean, however i listen to a lot off deep bass songs and unfortunately these headphones just aren't meant for it. The bass isn't deep at all and there is no treble whatsoever. Active noise cancellation: It does the job surprisingly well, when in metro or noise streets and turned on i can't hear any of that. I decided to give it a go and try while playing on my computer but after an hour or so I get a headache because of the sound that's phase-inverted by 180 degrees, it's weird but i can almost feel a very low noise pitch when its ON. Ambient sound: This is a new thing for me, never tried it before but its a great addition as I can wear the headphones and still talk to people or listen to announcements at the station/airport. However there is a bit of static noise that can be heard and unfortunately it lowers the sound quality. Bluetooth: Range is high, it definitely covers 10 meters and the V5.0 is used. What surprised me is that the headphones can be connected to several devices at once! I really wished that i could give them 5 stars but um there are just too many discrepancies that need fixing, but these are definitely good budget noise cancellation headphones that will do the job."}, {"date": "2021-01-10", "score": 0.836, "review": "These headphones have wonderful features and noise canceling for the price.

Das Design der Kopfhrer sieht ganz hbsch aus. Die rote Innenseite passt gut zum schwarzen Rest und die Oberflche ist etwas matter, somit sieht man auch nicht stndig irgendwelche Fingerabdrcke. Insgesamt also eher ein \"Standard-Design\", wie man es bei den meisten Kopfhrer findet. Der Klang ist gut. Insgesamt auf jeden Fall besser als bei meinen alten Taotronics Kopfhrern. Man darf natrlich nicht erwarten, dass man hier den gleichen Sound bekommt, wie bei 500+ Euro Studiokopfhrern. Positiv sticht fr mich die ANC-Leistung heraus. Ich nutze die Kopfhrer in der Regel beim Busfahren oder auch mal auf der Arbeit (Langzeitbaustelle direkt vor der Tr). Es werden deutlich mehr Gerusche herausgefiltert als bisher und im Bus hre ich quasi keinerlei andere Gerusche mehr neben der Musik. Besonders positiv finde ich, dass der Klang der Musik nicht so stark verndert wird, wenn man ANC einschaltet. Die Akkulaufzeit ist auf jeden Fall auch sehr gut. Wobei es natrlich einen Unterschied macht, ob man ANC aktiviert oder nicht. Ich kam bisher auf so etwa 40 Stunden im \"Mixbetrieb\" (also mal ANC aktiviert, mal deaktiviert). Das finde ich vollkommen in Ordnung zumal die Ladung auch fix geht. Im Lieferumfang waren bei mir noch ein normales 3,5mm Klinkekabel dabei und ein Mikro USB Kabel zum aufladen (leider kein Netzteil dazu, aber dies drften die meisten Zuhause haben). Insgesamt kann ich die Kopfhrer empfehlen, wenn man auf der Suche nach einem mittelpreisigen Kopfhrer ist, der ANC mitbringt."}, {"date": "2021-01-25", "score": 0.611, "review": "I bought for my daughter online school.Everything works perfect!"}, {"date": "2021-01-25", "score": 0.932, "review": "The headphones came in a bag which was very convenient.

The quality of sound, the weight, the ability of noise cancellation, and the color style is all something way better than my expectation. If you are looking for a noise cancellation, nice sound quality pair of headphone for a small price, SuperEQ S1 could be the best choice. The first item to note is that they have bluetooth 5.0 which means the connection range is pretty far. Since the bluetooth 5.0, the data transfer requests very low energy which means this headphone can pack a 30+ hour battery cruising life with all possible features on. If you want to have longer running time, then you can choose to turn off a couple of features. The noise cancellation functionality is the best part of this headphone. It has light weight and performs great sound. The bass is the most impressive part of it. People that do not want bass may want to stay clear of these, but from my testing I really enjoyed the sound. It comes with a charging cable, and a carry pouch. The SuperEq S1 is a great pair of headphone.

Amazingly, all the glowing reviews are actually true. I've had these over a week now, and having used them roughly 10 hrs the battery is still at 80% charge. The sound quality is so good I need to have the volume very low or it's overwhelming to my sensitive ears. (I fully recognize that my particular ears are sensitive to the point where earbuds are painful to me because the sound being directly in my ears is way too much, so others wouldn't need to have the volume so low on these.) The ANC is amazing. I've had other headphones in this price range and the ANC has been nonexistent, these work so well that the person I live with was sitting roughly 3 ft away and I could barely hear them. No music or any other sound, just ANC. The ambient ANC allows you to still hear people talking, and other ambient noise when you want things to be muffled but still hear what's going on around you. Even without ANC on, sound is pretty muffled because the pads on the ear pieces is so thick. My ears are small enough that they fit right into the ear pads, so ANC almost isn't necessary for me. They pair easily and come with charging cord, aux cord to use them wired, and an airplane adapter. They fold up nicely for storage when not in use, have a faux leather pouch to store them in, and easy instructions. There are a few things I'd change if I could tho: The headphones are a bit heavy, and they press very firmly against the head. It's not uncomfortable in general (even after several hours), but it means that I can't use the ANC when I have a headache (one of the reasons I wanted ANC). So, if you have a sensitive head and are bothered by heavier headphones, or are looking for ones specifically to use during migraines or other headaches, these might not be for you. The charging cord is laughably short. It's max 6\" long from end to end, so if you want to use the cord that comes with them you need to charge them using a plug just above a counter or table if you don't want them on the floor. The good thing is they charge with a standard mini-USB, so the cord for my tablet works and gives me the length to plug them into a standard lower wall outlet where one of my USB wall adapters lives and sit on a table next to it instead of the floor. Lastly, the instructions, while easy to understand, are printed with all language variations on the pages at once rather than having a separate version of each language in a thicker booklet. I'm sure this was done to save on printing costs, which is understandable, but it makes picking out the info you need from a page with three different languages printed on the same space a little difficult. Other than those three things, these headphones are pretty perfect. For $60, these are an amazing bargain.

Hier befindet sich auch der An/Ausschalter und der Knopf frs Noise-Cancelling, das finde ich persnlich sehr angenehm, dann damit werden Umgebungsgerusche sehr wirksam herausgefiltert, sodass man sich auf die gerade laufende Musik oder das Hrspiel konzentrieren kann. Mchte man sich unterhalten, wenn man z.B. gerade angesprochen wird, schaltet man den Transparenz-Modus ein. Dann kann man sich trotz Musik sehr gut unterhalten, ohne die Kopfhrer abnehmen zu mssen.

So lange habe ich allerdings noch nicht gehrt. Bei mir kam der Kopfhrer an und ich habe ihn den ganzen Abend benutzt, ohne ihn vorher zu laden. Das waren schon ca 5 Stunden am Stck. Das Koppeln mit dem PC oder Smartphone funktioniert Kinderleicht.

Sa simplicit dutilisation, son confort (car il est bien rembourr), sa maniabilit (rglable et pliable mais du coup plus fragile), sa qualit dcoute et de rendu sonore, sa praticit de transport (pochette souple) sont des atouts qui font de ce produit un indispensable pour tous ceux qui aiment voyager et couter de la musique (un connecteur double jack est fourni pour connecter dans les avions). Sa fonction Bluetooth permet davoir une totale libert de ses mains et cest vraiment trs apprciable de ne plus avoir de fil qui se ballade mais possibilit galement de connecter le casque avec le cble jack 3,5mm fourni. Son tui de rangement est souple, il peut renfermer le casque pli avec ses diverses connectiques pour permettre de le transporter tout en le protgeant de la poussire dommage quil ne soit pas rigide pour protger aussi des chocs ventuels. Lutilisation est simple, avant de lutiliser il faut le charger avec son cble, ensuite avec le Bluetooth, le casque est reconnu rapidement par lappareil source et lorsquon coute de la musique via son tlphone, on entend si il y a un appel et on peut choisir de dcrocher ou non, le micro est intgr au casque et nest pas visible. Il faudra un petit temps pour matriser les commandes au niveau du casque car la notice est en Anglais mais elles sont assez simples, on peut rgler le volume, dcrocher un appel ou pas, activer la rduction de bruit Jutilise ce casque souvent en ce moment car avec cette priode de tltravail forc, mon mari est juste  ct de moi dans le bureau, ce qui nest pas simple pour se concentrer lorsquil est au tlphone en runion, du coup, avec la rduction de bruit de ce casque, je me mets de la musique pour bosser et lui, je ne lentends plus hihihi ! La pression du casque sur les oreilles se fait ressentir au bout dun moment et larceau na pas de bande lastique pour assouplir du coup cest un peu raide sur le crne mais le casque insonorise bien les bruits extrieurs si on active la rduction de bruit. Le son est net, on est dans sa bulle et le son du micro lors de la prise dappel est galement performant cest apprciable mais attention, tant donn qu'on entend pas les sons extrieurs on a tendance  parler fort sans s'en rendre compte et il faudra galement faire attention pour une utilisation en mode piton car la rduction de bruit peut savrer dangereuse dans la rue car on entend plus lenvironnement sonore et les avertissements en cas de danger. Un casque avec un son de qualit et une rduction de bruit assez efficace qui propose un prix trs abordable pour une fois (59,99 euros) compar  ses concurrents de grandes marques plus performants sur la rduction de bruit mais qui arborent des prix  trois chiffres... Un produit accessible et de qualit, je recommande pour ceux qui ont des petits budgets et qui ne peuvent pas se payer les autres de style Jabra et Cie."}, {"date": "2020-11-07", "score": 0.912, "review": "Les casques cachent souvent des dsillusions, pourtant ce Super EQ S1 se la joue dans la cour des grands. D'abord par sa prsentation noire, larges coquilles noires entourant bien les pavillons d'oreilles et sa mousse amortissante rouge rellement efficace. La casque serre un peu le crne, mais le confort est bon. Je l'ai test longuement d'abord en filaire sur l'ordinateur. Ce n'est pas son point fort, son frre S2 s'en mieux  moins cher, de plus le cordon est trop court.  Mais en Bluetooth sur le smartphone, le S2 prend un avantage indniable. On atteint le sublime sur le saxo de Candy Dulfer avec Lily was here, la guitare lectrique y est aussi extraordinaire de beaut, on touche l'anthologie. Je recommande fort ce morceau  tous les amateurs du genre. Je me suis aussi rgaler en coutant Hauser  Zagreb, ou David Bowie en duo avec Freddie Mercury . Que dire de la guitare de Mark Knopfler, et de sa voix qui se superpose en crant un espace sonore de bon aloi, trs raliste. L'ANC, rduction du bruit ambiant n'entame pratiquement pas le caractre volontaire de ce petit casque. Cela mrite d'tre soulign car c'est loin d'une gnralit. La qualit des sons est remarquable, basses solides et propres, mdium excellent et un aigu raisonnablement coup vers 20 kHz pour obtenir une performance honorable. J'ai test et cout des centaines de casques et d'enceintes de tous les prix un peu partout en France. Ce que je peux vous assurer,  ce tarif, le S2 est imbattable. Musique et spatialisation sont trs rares  ce niveau de gamme.

Ergonomie: C'est le point ou je mettrais un bmol il sert un peu la tte moi qui n'est pourtant pas une grosse tte, heureusement les coussinets d'oreilles sont confortables, l'avantage c'est qu'il tient sur la tte dans toutes les situations. Isolation: La encore une trs bonne impression l'isolation du bruit passive, comme active ce montre efficace, a ce niveau de prix c'est mme excellent.

They came delivered nicely packaged in a well-presented retail box and along with the headphones you get a travel pouch, charge cable, 3.5mm AUX cable, airplane adapter, and the user guide. Im pleased with the quality of them, the plastic feels strong and durable, they arent too lightweight that they feel cheap, the ear cups and headband are very soft and comfortable, and they generally look nice when your wearing them. The headphones are comfortable to wear and grip your head quite tightly, so they wont be falling off if you decide to go for a run with them. Pairing them with my Galaxy S20+ was simple and they were up and running in seconds. The sound quality is very good and Im quite impressed with them to be honest, the sound is clear, well-balanced and you get a nice amount of bass from them. I would like them to be a bit louder when in Bluetooth mode, but the max volume is fine when using the wired connection and it seems to be an issue most BT headphones suffer with anyway. Call quality while using them is good, I can hear the person clearly and they can hear me with no issues. Without them even being switched on they do a great job of insulating sound from the outside and when you turn the ANC on you can barely hear any external noise at all. Im working from home at the moment but I have a fan heater which you can still hear while wearing the headphones until the moment you turn ANC on and the noise disappears, very impressive to be honest! The ambient mode also works well as it uses the mic to let you hear external sounds and you get a slight amplification so you can actually hear a bit better while wearing them. Overall, for around 60 I think these headphones are a great purchase and good value for money. The sound quality is great, battery life excellent, they are comfortable, and you get a good quality travel pouch with them which is a nice addition. Im very happy to recommend this item and I feel theyre worth the full five stars, I just wish they would go a little bit louder!", "worst_review": "Your browser does not support HTML5 video. WOW ! Wirklich, ich bin ziemlich geflasht von diesen Onear-Kopfhrern. Zuerst einmal zum Klang: Dieser ist hervorragend. Die Hhen sind sehr klar und die Bsse satt, ohne zu bersteuern. Einfach herrlich. So sollten Kopfhrer klingen ! Die Lautstrke lsst sich am rechten Hrer regulieren. Hier befindet sich auch der An/Ausschalter und der Knopf frs Noise-Cancelling, das finde ich persnlich sehr angenehm, dann damit werden Umgebungsgerusche sehr wirksam herausgefiltert, sodass man sich auf die gerade laufende Musik oder das Hrspiel konzentrieren kann. Mchte man sich unterhalten, wenn man z.B. gerade angesprochen wird, schaltet man den Transparenz-Modus ein. Dann kann man sich trotz Musik sehr gut unterhalten, ohne die Kopfhrer abnehmen zu mssen. Wirklich eine sehr gute Lsung. Der akku ist sehr schnell geladen. Ca 2 Stunden und das Gert ist wieder einsatzbereit. Ca 45 Stunden soll die Laufzeit betragen. So lange habe ich allerdings noch nicht gehrt. Bei mir kam der Kopfhrer an und ich habe ihn den ganzen Abend benutzt, ohne ihn vorher zu laden. Das waren schon ca 5 Stunden am Stck. Das Koppeln mit dem PC oder Smartphone funktioniert Kinderleicht. Bluetooth einschalten ( auf dem Kopfhrer den Koppeln Knopf auf der rechten Seite ca 3 Sekunden halten und dann auf dem PC oder Smartphone koppeln. Die Reichweite ist enorm, bei mir hatte ich ber 3 Etagen im Haus vollen Musikgenuss (Kopplung mit dem PC). Die Kopfhrer lassen sich aber auch per Klinke an den PC oder die Musikanlage anschlieen, man schont dann die Akkus. Die Ohrmuscheln sind sehr, sehr weich und liegen absolut angenehm auf den Ohren, ohne zu drcken oder nerven, auch wenn man mal eine Lesebrille aufsetzt. Hervorragend. Der Kopfhrer lsst sich zusammenklappen und in der mitgelieferten Tasche transportieren. Von mir eine absolute Kaufempfehlung und 5 Sterne !", "neutral": "... que pour l'audio  mon avis (ou alors, techno). Les basses sont trs prsentes au dtriment du mdium aigu (les voix sont un peu en retrait). Mais rien de catastrophique  ce niveau de prix. La rduction de bruit est en retrait par rapport aux meilleurs (Sony, B&O, Bose, qui sont 5 fois plus cher), mais a le mrite d'tre propose. Plus confortable que le S2 de la marque (oreillettes plus larges), mais appuie sur les branches de lunettes quand mme."}, "word_cloud": "null"}}
