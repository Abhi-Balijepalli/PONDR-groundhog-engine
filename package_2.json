Maybe Wyze has been cranking out so many new products lately, that they can not keep up with the support of infrastructure and/or existing hardware.  Whatever it is, reliability needs to improve.  My original review follows... I bought 2 of the Wyze Cams in February 2019 to supplement my 4 Arlo cameras that I have owned for several years.  Here are some of the things that I like about the Wyze Cam First the price, which is wow this is a fantastic camera for $25!  To add just 1 Arlo to my existing 4 cameras would set me back $150, or the same price as 6 Wyze Cams.  The packaging is well done and minimalistic.  Setting up the camera was 4 easy steps that took about 5 minutes, very simple.  The camera articulates nicely on its base so that I can mount the base, which is also magnetic, and get the camera pointing in the desired direction.  The app works well on my iPhone with no issues.  The wifi range seems adequate and compares well to the Arlo.  You can shut off the IR light through the software, which helps when looking out a window at night to eliminate reflection.  Motion detection and notification seems to work better than my Arlo cameras.  My Arlos frequently trigger recording after an object has moved past the frame, completely missing the action, and I have yet to see the Wyze Cam do the same.  Picture quality is excellent and with a SD card they store several days of continuous video.  The software/firmware stability is so-far flawless and surpasses my experience with several painful Arlo updates and software flaws in the early days.  Construction looks and feels solid, however the Arlos win on construction as they are weather proof and they have survived several years of outdoor use for me. Here are some things that would improve the Wyze Cam. First and foremost I would like to see an application for my iMac that would allow me to see my cameras in the same way that I can see them with the iPhone app.  Actually, a web based app would allow access anywhere, but raises some security concerns. A more revealing and complete explanation of some of the features of this camera would be appreciated.  Wyze has a q&a section on their web page that does a pretty good job, but not everything is covered there.  One question that I have not found an answer too is what, how, and where the images are stored.  Its not immediately clear what gets stored on the SD card and what goes to the internet.  Although internet connectivity and storage is a concern, I also believe internet storage is a benefit, because a burglar could steal the camera and you will still have the video of the theft when stored remotely.  Arlos store everything remotely as well, but provide a bit more control over remote storage. The power cord is bulky for such a tiny camera.  I will be looking for different power supply options including battery and solar.  Also a USB Light Bulb LampCharger like the one by NYCE Power also might come in handy for powering this camera. An outdoor version of this camera would be nice.  I may try a DIY project to make it weather resistant as others have, because at $25 a camera why not?  The Reolink Argus Pro w/ solar is another good out of the box option, but at a higher price. Improve the playback and editing of continuous video by adding a fast forward, video cutting and storage transfer.  The software slider works well, but better tools for playback are needed. New buyers, maker sure you purchase a fast 16 or 32 gb SD card with this camera. Besides proven durability, the only major thing that Arlo has over the Wyze is outdoor use and 100% completely wireless operation, although the Arlo batteries are a bit of a hassle and expensive.  I could buy a couple of Wyze Cams for what I pay in batteries for my Arlos each year.  The bottom line is that the Wyze Cam an incredibly good investment.", "worst_review": "These cameras are nearly useless even as a basic remote security camera; it is not nearly reliable enough to be to the foundation of a home security monitoring system. Picture quality is good enough (but not great), as is the night vision. The primary issue I have is with the fickle responsiveness. I dont know if its a problem with the app, hardware, or both, but more often than not, I will see at least one of the cameras as being offline and unreachable. It will magically reconnect whenever it feels like it. If I hear activity that I want to check on, more often than not the camera will be offline, or will just refuse to connect. Changing camera settings in the app is equally unreliable, where it takes uncomfortably long for the individual camera settings to load, if they load at all. It makes it difficult to determine if youve actually configured the camera and whether the settings have stuck or not. Reviewing video is equally hit-or-miss; some captured motion event videos will appear but are unviewable, with a vague message saying the the video doesnt exist. Why is it visible in the events list, then? Also, the motion detection regularly fails to trigger whenever there is movement that should trigger it (probably due to a camera being sporadically offline). The cameras cannot be relied upon to capture everything that happens in front of it.

UPDATE: I discovered that you have to pay extra for a subscription to get that perk. These cameras are adequate if youre on a budget and you absolutely need something, but be aware that they will eventually fail you when you need them.
