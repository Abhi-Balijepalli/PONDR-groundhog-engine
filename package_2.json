I started researching online to see if there were any products out there that would make it easier to depress the center red button and I came across this product. Let me tell you, I am so in love with this as a mom but also as a hand therapist. I see many arthritis patients who suffer from debilitating arthritis at the base of the thumb. Unfortunately, by the time I see them in therapy, it is already so far gone and painful that they can only resort to surgery to help alleviate the pain. I know that since I am relatively young, this product will help save my hand. I think all parents need to know about this product. Your thumb might not hurt now while you're young, but it certainly may later on if you don't protect your joints. This product uses the power of leverage to greatly reduce the amount of force required from your hand to unbuckle your child from the carseat. I considered other similar, yet different products on amazon and there were 3 problems: 1) they attach to the carseat which invalidates the manufacturer's warranty 2) if they attach to the carseat, your child may unbuckle themselves mid-ride 3) the product may not use enough leverage to actually reduce the force you need to unbuckle.

The product worked okay for that, but then once my son was old enough, I allowed him to start using that product to get himself out of his carseat, as we were expecting our third child and he would be going into the back of our minivan and I didn't want to have to climb in and out each time to help him unless necessary. He eventually figured it out, but it was fairly difficult and not super reliable. I was still having to get into the backseat multiple times per week to help him out.

What the previous product lacked was something to go under the buckle to push against, plus it was bulky. The UnbuckleMe seemed great. Light, easy design and it does not require much force to get the buckle open. There's even a little hole to allow a keychain loop to be added. My daughter had been wanting the other product for herself, as she's highly independent, so I purchased the UnbuckleMe for her instead to try out. She's pleased as punch! She's not quite able to use the UnbuckleMe by herself (she's 3), but I'm okay with that, since she's so young. My 5 yo can use it without any difficulties.

One kid is facing forward, the other is rear facing, so I have some reaching to do on each. The UnbuckleMe was recommended to me by my physical therapist. I love the idea. My only real gripe is that if the children are in convertible car seats with NHTSA (National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration) approved 5-point harnesses, it is really difficult to get the UnbuckleMe into place to click the button. It's not long enough to go over top, which would be the easiest way to do it. To use it as is, I loosen the harness as much as possible, pull it out and then sort of shove the UnbuckleMe behind the buckle in front of my kids legs, trying to avoid pinching their chubby little thighs. It's actually harder for me to move the UnbuckleMe around than to just unbuckle the car seat. It needs two more inches at the closed end.

After reading about the development of your product and that an OT was involved I ordered it (and showed my OT so she had one less reason to worry about my recovery until my next therapy). I found the Unbuckle Me amazing and so easy to use. It takes a few seconds to get in place and then with little effort the car seat unbuckles.

The product worked okay for that, but then once my son was old enough, I allowed him to start using that product to get himself out of his carseat, as we were expecting our third child and he would be going into the back of our minivan and I didn't want to have to climb in and out each time to help him unless necessary. He eventually figured it out, but it was fairly difficult and not super reliable. I was still having to get into the backseat multiple times per week to help him out. I heard about the UnbuckleMe on a carseat safety group I belong to. And I loved the design of it. What the previous product lacked was something to go under the buckle to push against, plus it was bulky. The UnbuckleMe seemed great. Light, easy design and it does not require much force to get the buckle open. There's even a little hole to allow a keychain loop to be added. My daughter had been wanting the other product for herself, as she's highly independent, so I purchased the UnbuckleMe for her instead to try out. She's pleased as punch! She's not quite able to use the UnbuckleMe by herself (she's 3), but I'm okay with that, since she's so young. My 5 yo can use it without any difficulties. Since we've only used it for about a week or so, I'm not sure how durable it is, especially when children are the primary users of it in my home anyway.
