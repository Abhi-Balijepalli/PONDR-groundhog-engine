The bass is lacking in my opinion. No matter what I put the settings on , the bass just wasn't quite there. My skull candy crusher wireless had way more bass for half the price. These Sony's were just not loud/clear enough, with the bass just not quite being there. Also, the active noise canceling is actually worse than the one on my MPOW H12 headphones, and they were $39!!! I guess you are paying for the name and features(with the sony app) , because I have no idea why these are so expensive. Either these reviews are mostly fake, or people just have low standards as far as headphones. I didn't even bother with call quality because these were such a disappointment, along with the fact that there's an annoying chime that constantly goes off while listening to music.

While the bass is nice, and the battery life is great (30hrs is true), the sound cancelation and comfort are not the best. Comfort: Ive worn the headphones for about an hour, and the headphones are already making my head sore. Also, the sides are not padded so it makes all of the pressure of the headphones end up on the top of your head. Noise cancelation: The headphones dont cancel sound very well. I had the headphones at maximum cancelation and I could still hear my surroundings almost as if they were never on at all. All they do is make my ears feel as if theyre clogged (like they would on an airplane). Sound quality: If you like bass, these are pretty solid on the sound. The bass feels like a movie theaters bass around my ears. So they get a plus on that. Battery life: The battery life is great, 30hrs of life is absolutely correct. Sensors: I personally dislike the touch sensor for volume control. I get its Sony trying to make something new, but it is very inefficient. It makes adjusting the volume very tedious. For example, sometimes when I try to adjust the volume, sometimes I end up skipping the song. And if pretty much anything burshes up against the sensor (clothing, hair, etc), its going to change something. Price: Price is decent for this set. $150 is not too bad considering everything that comes with the headphones, but I would suggest getting a different model that isnt as finackey as this set is for the money."}, {"date": "2019-12-28", "score": 0.8, "review": "This are great, Im in love with them since I got them, not the best on the market obviously but great for the price and very comfy.

First off, the sound quality is very clear. I'm hearing details that I wasn't getting in the xb950bt headphones, especially in the mid to low frequencies. The XB950bt already have great quality audio so I was surprised by how noticeable of an upgrade these were. They managed to get a LOT of bass out of these without it effecting the mid at all. On the XB950bt, if you turned up the bass with the headphones app, the song would start to distort because the entire headphone would shake. Now the bass is much more solid and controllable while still sounding big. I listen to mostly EDM so the amount of bass is perfect. I did listen to some non EDM music and I can see why people who don't listen to bass music wouldn't like these. It's just a bit too in-your-face. You can turn the bass down in the app though. So if you're wanting a cheaper version of the Sony 1000xm3 but are afraid the bass will be too much, turning down the bass on the headphones app will make them sound more natural. Instruments sound as if they are really there in your head. The noise cancelling is nothing special. I don't have anything to compare to but it was only able to cancel the low frequencies while mowing the lawn. you can change how much cancellation there is and at one end it actually increases the noise around you. I like this feature because I want to be aware of my surroundings while in the house. I really like how you can cover the right ear to turn down the volume and it amplifies the sound around you so you can hear people talking to you. It's very fast and consistent but will look funny and rude to strangers if you try talking to them like this. The Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa button make these headphones feel modern. You hold it for the Assistant or you can fast click it to have your notifications read to you. Only problem is if you want to use it, you can't toggle noise cancelling because it uses the same button. You have to choose which one you want in the headphones app. I don't see why they couldn't add an extra button so there are no compromises; there's plenty of space for another. Or there could be a double click to toggle noise cancelling. There's an option called adaptive sound control that changes the noise cancelling intensity based on if you're sitting, walking, running, or in a moving vehicle. -This would be a very useful feature but every time you get up and move or sit down, it plays a bell notification and stops the music. You can't use adaptive sound control without it playing the sound and it makes it too annoying to use. Pretty unfortunate and hopefully they get rid of the notification with a software update or make it an option.- EDIT: there's a setting to turn off the bell notification and guides. You can change the spacial position of the sound with the headphones app. If that's useful to you, now you know. I've already accidently skipped the track a few times with the touch pad. You have to be careful touching the headphones on the right side since it doesn't use physical buttons, just swipe gestures. Hopefully I can get used to it and it not be a problem. The touch gestures seem to be pretty responsive so far, but it can be a little hard not to skip a track when you mean to turn the volume up. It also takes forever to adjust the volume any significant amount cause of how much motion each volume tick takes. If you need to quickly lower the volume, you'll have to use your phone. The main advantage to having swipe gestures is that it won't break. The volume up button stopped working on my xb950bt less than a year after I bought them and the track switch button was pretty finicky after two years. I'm only assuming these headphones will last longer because the touch screens on our phones don't just stop working out of nowhere. Also, I do like how easy it is to pause the music with a double tap on the right speaker. Just wish it was a little faster. EDIT: It's getting really frustrating how difficult it is to change the volume without skipping the track. Sometimes, even if I swipe directly up (which is for volume up) it STILL skips the track I'm playing. There's nothing more frustrating than getting into a song and wanting to turn it up only for it to skip the song you're jamming to. They really need to fix this in a software update and make it much more difficult to skip the track. At this point I only use my phone for volume changes which is annoying because the main reason I like the touch controls is because the volume button won't break like my last headphones. I've had some problems with the Bluetooth connection. It stopped working on me one time during a call and another time trying to play music. The call was on a Snapchat game with my music in the background. The other time it disconnected, there were two apps with audio playing at the same time. So I'm guessing it disconnects whenever there's an overload of input. My girlfriend told me the call quality was really good without me telling her I was using my new headphones so that's a plus. I'll update if it continues to disconnect. EDIT: I haven't had any more problems with this. I think it might have just been Snapchat calling that messed it up. They're not very comfortable for long periods of time. I've been wearing them all day today and honestly they're starting to hurt my head. I just put on the XB950BT and my head already feels better with them on. The xb900n presses around your ears a bit more and the cups aren't as big so the speaker touches my ears a little. They really just need bigger pads, even though it would ruin the thin look. Honestly, the best thing about these headphones are USB-C. I can finally charge my headphones with the same charger as my phone. This is a deal breaking feature and the biggest reason Id rather have these than the XB-950N1 despite its issues. These headphones feel very modern and stylish compared to the bulky and outdated XB950BT. The biggest problems can be fixed with software updates like the touch controls and double tapping Google Assistant to toggle noise cancelling. Hardware wise, these headphones are almost perfect with the biggest issues being the small ear pads and cheap plastic.

The noise cancelling works very well for an office environment. The feature of cupping your hand over the earpiece to lower the volume and turn off noise cancelling is very handy.

Battery seems to last a long time, I didn't charge them when I took them out of the box and was able to get a week of listening for a few hours a day and still have about 30% battery left. Range is really good, too. I have them paired to my Mac Mini in my office and I can walk to the break room in the next room without them dropping signal (but no further than that.) That's about 35 feet with 4 interior walls. My only two complaints are: After wearing for a few hours it does make my ears feel hot and start to sweat. They're comfortable to wear, but I have to take them off and let my ears cool down several times during the day. And the touch-sensitive controls on the ear piece are just weird and seem hit-or-miss.

They definitely don't sound as clear as either of the two, but they still sound great. They are less flat sounding and more lively and fun. If you want your ears to vibrate like the Skullcady Crushers, set the equalizer to Exited and set the headphones to Arena mode, then crank up the volume, while nowhere near as much vibration as the skullcandys, its there if youre into that. NOISE CANCELLING, I would say these headphones cancel about 60%-70% of the noise that the Bose QC35s and XM3s/Bose 700s cancel out (which is really good).  I would definitely place these in the top 10 noise cancelling headphones out there. However if you only want noise cancelling then you might want to look into the Sony 1000XM3 or Bose 700. With the XB900N you will still be able to hear some outside noise such as loud fans, chatter, etc at low volumes (40% or so) if you want to block out noise fully it is possible but you will have to crank them up to 70-80% volume. I listen to them at about 40% volume and its loud enough for me, while other headphones i have to set them near 80% volume. BLUETOOTH AND APP, these are very easy to connect to your devices, hold the power button for 7 seconds then they go into pairing mode, then just connect to them using your device...no hastle. The app also works flawlessly and let me tell you this app is no joke! - You can change the noise cancelling level (20 levels). - You can set between amazon alexa or google assistant - You can change the sound to come from front, front left/right, or rear left/right. - The have an equalizer which lets you adjust bass, mids, highs, etc. It also comes with some presets if you want to just boost bass, vocals, trebble etc. This equalizer really changes the way these headphones sound, this aint no gimmick! - Surround VPT, I dont know why this feature is not that popular but when you change it creates a feeling of surround sound, the settings are Arena, Concert Hall, Outdoor Stage, and Club. When you set the headphones to arena mode and you watch a movie it literally sounds like you have two soundbars in your ears, its insane that a simple setting on an app can make such a difference... these things sound like a movie theatre! I have owned many pair of headphones, and you get what you pay for. I would definitely say these are worth the $250 price tag. In a nutshell... Those who want a good pair of headphones and want to save $100 buy the XB900Ns. If you want basically double the noise cancelling, and a cleaner sound (less bass) get the Sony XM3s.

It feels great not to have to untangle a wire every time I want to listen to something, and the noise cancelling makes a welcome difference when I'm between classes at my university. If the \"Extra Bass\" makes you question if these are right for you, you might want to look elsewhere, but I find that these provide a rich sound in the low end without overpowering higher notes, at least without any additional equalizer tweaks. While the noise cancellation is good, don't expect miracles. If I'm listening to something quiet, or there's a particularly loud noise, I can still hear the outside world. On the other hand, wind can be a real issue when wearing these outside. The noise cancellation's attempt to counter the wind really just ends up with me hearing the wind blowing through the microphones, in which case it's better to just turn it off. The ambient sound pass-through mode is good in theory, but in practice you'll have to turn down your music volume for it to make much difference. Thankfully, putting your hand over the right earcup lowers your music volume and automatically turns on ambient sound mode, which is incredibly convenient when you need to listen to someone briefly without having to take them off your ears or pause your music. The battery life is as good as promised, it feels like I never need to charge them. That's good, since while these headphones have a 3.5 mm cable jack, and they support passive audio, the sound quality is absolutely terrible without the battery charged and the set powered on.

Sony decided to mimic these headphones with their high end wh-1000xm3 models when it comes to controls.  With only a power buttons and a NC button now you use gesture controls to change songs, play/pause your music, change tracks, lower and raise the volume, and answer your phone calls.  To increase volume, swipe up with one finger on the right ear cup, pause/play, tap it, and if you cover the entire cup with your hand, it will lower the music, and let the mics let the outside noise in so you could talk to someone.

The quick set-up guide is comprehensive with step-by-step instructions for using the headphones, a trouble-shooting checklist, technical specifications and detailed explanations for using each feature. The headphones have a non-reflective black finish, substantial bass-producing drivers and super-soft memory-foam cushions on each headphone for superb comfort and noise isolation. They fold flat to enable compact storage and to easily fit into a purse, drawers, etc. The Sony WH-XB900N has a look of quiet quality and business elegance without flashy excess. First step is to charge the headphones. Just attach the USB-C charging cable, plug it into your computer or a USB outlet and LED lights will go out when they are fully charged (which may take 4- 6 hours when fully discharged.) A red LED light next to the charging port goes out when the unit is fully charged. The stated music playing time of thirty hours seems conservative since I found the headphones would operate for nearly forty hours before fading out. The customizable auto-off feature aids this very long battery life. Next, press the power button to turn them on  an audio prompt indicates when the power is on or off. Pair the earphones with your phone or other source via Bluetooth or NFC. An audio prompt guides you, but my phone paired them very quickly and without drama. A blue LED indicates the connection has been made. The connection remained very solid throughout my home, up to nearly 50 feet. The headphones are fully adjustable and the very soft pads completely and comfortably enclose even the largest ears. The Sony WH-XB900N are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn. They are light (9 ounces) and have plenty of adjustment range to enable a perfect fit. The earphone pads are fairly large (about 4 inches tall and 3 inches wide) so they qualify as over ear and they provide excellent sound isolation. You can wear them for many hours in perfect comfort and your ears will never complain. Even without the noise-canceling function most external sounds are blocked. Pressing the Custom (automatic noise canceling) button turns on that feature and there is an audio announcement that it is active (or that it has been turned off.) The ANC technology is very effective for mid-frequency noise. I turned on both my shower and bathroom sink faucet and the noise (which would normally be very loud) was just a faint hiss which I could easily ignore while listening to the music. Even without music playing the noise canceling feature was pretty effective. Further, you can adjust the degree of noise cancellation using the Headphone Connect app. These would be great on a noisy airplane ride! The Sony WH-XB900N headphones have a very accurate reproduction of music from bass through mid-range notes and on to the highest frequencies. You can modify the sound contour/response by utilizing the Sony Headphone Connect app which features a full equalizer, a number of surround sound presets and sound positioning controls. For those who like heavy bass these are an ideal choice. If you want to cut back the bass the equalizer on the app will do that very effectively. I played every range of music, from classical, blues, hard rock, jazz and a full range of vocals (opera through folk ballads) and these fine headphones never disappointed me. The sound quality is just beautiful. Sony has positioned these headphones to deliver premium sound and features at a mid-range price. Yes, you might find slightly better headphones but only if you are willing to spend at least 50% more, and even then most users would not really appreciate any difference in sound or features. Like all good earphones these will respond to various voice commands, allow you to interact with Siri, take calls, etc. Each earphone has some controls. The right side has a nice touch pad which will raise/lower volume, skip tracks (forward and backward), pause and repeat tracks and has a microphone for use during calls. The left side turns the earphones on/off, handles Bluetooth pairing, activates the noise cancelation feature and also takes calls. One very clever feature is Quick Attention which shuts off noise cancellation and lowers music volume when you touch the right headphone, enabling you to easily hear outside sounds (such as someone speaking to you), and then resumes noise cancellation and music volume when you remove your hand. Bottom line - the Sony WH-XB900N noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones are an excellent value for discerning music fans who want a very comfortable headset, superb noise isolation and beautiful sound reproduction. They are a perfect choice for traveling and would pass boring hours in airports and on planes with gold stars for quality, sound level and range. I am happy to award this fine product a full five stars and my full, unqualified endorsement. Buy these if you love music and want sweet isolation from the nasty noises of the world!vertised and highly recommended."}, {"date": "2020-01-10", "score": 0.988, "review": "These headphones are great. Connection is stable, sound and bass are good and the noise canceling works. My head is quite small and I dislike that they are a bit loose on my head, it feel comfy when I stand but I always feel like they are gonna fall off if I move too fast with my head down. Also instinctively I try to readjust them by touching the round parts and those sensors get activated automatically. So now I need to learn how to touch them which is annoying. The design is simple, plastic seems very durable, soft leather like details around ears and on the top of headband could get damaged quite easily so I would recommend using a protective case. To me this design is a bit too simple, although I love minimalistic style, I wish it could be more sophisticated. My husband likes the size because his head is large. It seems like he was annoyed with sensors too at first but now getting used to them.

Before this pair, my max spend on headphones would be around $25-50 (and that'd be stretching it) The ones I have had before would have decent sound, nothing amazing but still decent nonetheless and noise cancelling would be a complete joke. My office environment is fairly noisy and I commute on a light rail to and from work. In addition to that I was looking for something that produced better sound so I could better tune out the distractions and focus on my work. I didn't have the money for the top-of-the line headphones (such as the Sony WH-1000XM3) so my review won't be comparing these headphones to the top of line ones. I don't like how you have to reset the bluetooth sync every time you connect  to a new device, but I compensate for that by only listening to them via bluetooth on my phone and I hard wire them into my computer by an audio cable. I do want to mention that the audio quality is far superior on my phone then on the computer as a result of the phone app, but my computer is a work supplied computer for work and not for listening to music so the audio is baseline at best. If we were to upgrade the audio card on the computer I'm confident it would be far better experience. I wish that there was some sort of water proofing, especially for the price I paid. I also wish that bluetooth paired better between devices as I would love to listen to other devices using these headphones. I've had some issues with phone calls while using these, the wind noise is much more pronounced and the mics tend to pick up everything around me. I once made the mistake of talking on a phone in the stairs and the quality was soooo poor that the support representative of the company I was talking to just hung up after telling me to call back cause he couldn't understand me hahaha (I have had many successful phone calls in the same stairs so I know it was the headphones). I do feel like I'm yelling when I'm using these phones I feel much more self conscious then I did with my previous headphones I used for phone calls The sound quality of these, especially when used on my phone with the sony headphone app on it, is AMAZING great Bass replication, the highs are not piercing as well. It is a truly enjoyable experience. Overall, I really enjoy these headphones. The sound quality is incredible, the noise cancellation is exactly what I was hoping for, and if I have something playing through the headphones (music, movie, audio of some sort) you hardly hear anything but your audio which is incredible!

I had shopped around for a while before settling on these, I picked them up because they were advertised for thier long battery life, good sound fidelity, bass and USB C recharging. I had purchased several cheaper headphones in the past few months but was ultimately disappointed with each. What can I say about these other then HOW AWESOME THEY ARE? Well, the bass really is amazing, if I'm listening to a heavy song it's like my entire head is shaking, it's an experience. The sound fidelity is great and far exceeds all previous headphones I've used, everything sounds crisp; none of that dull foggy sound you get from poor audio. The battery life is extreme, I never expected to get undersold on how long they last, I use these things at work and need to charge them every other shift, I work 12 hour shifts. The interactability on these is... what you would expect from a pair of headphones, the right ear has a seires of motions you can make to lower and raise the volume, attenuate the volume, pause, play, skip or goback. The left ear has two smaller buttons, a power button and a button to cycle through the various noise cancelation setups, I particularly like the mode that takes in and amplifies the surrounding audio so you can still hear things. My two gripes: First, I wish the buttons and interactability was truely customizable, there is a small amount of customization available but nothing extensive; particularly I wish I had the option to ceate a PTT button. Second, I wish I knew what a good pair of headphones were like, I would have purchased an even fancier pair from Sony.

The headphones fold up perfectly to fit in the case which is a good size for traveling.

The sound quality is outstanding (of course, it's Sony). Perfect headphone for those looking for a mid-grade professional headphone. Crisp and clear highs/mids with an extra little kick of pronounced bass. The bass is not heavy hitting unless tweaked via EQ, but just enough to come through clean and pleasing. I listened to The Power of Love by Sade for the first time in a long time and it almost brought me to tears. I went out and had to buy a Monster Cable AUX cord because the included one is very short (but it was worth the $10 along with the Bluetooth adapter for $20). There is no possible way you can charge this headset with the included cable since it is literally 6\" long. I'll use my Samsung charger for my phone until I can find a better alternative so that I do not damage the headphones. The touch controls are fantastic and responsive if you can actually feel your way around perfect the first time since there is NO indicators/symbols on the headphones themselves. You can also completely turn off the headset by holding your ear over the right ear-cuff and it will resume playback after removing that hand. The ONLY reason I MUST remove a star is because for gaming I suggest you DO NOT USE BLUETOOTH FUNCTION FOR GAMING (unless you can somehow make an EQ when Bluetooth is enabled which I unfortunately do not know how to do). The Bluetooth sound quality for games is absolutely horrible, tinny, hollow and inaccurate. But with a AUX cable plugged in and an EQ set through your audio driver, GOOD GOD. Perfection. Maybe I'm just using them wrong? No clue. All I know is they are CLOSE to perfect. And for the price you CANNOT go wrong. Super light-weight, comfortable, forms to your head perfect, creates an amazing seal around your ears as it hugs them perfectly and built pretty well. If someone reads this and can tell me how to get the same audio quality results through Bluetooth function for games that I get with a cable, PLEASE HELP and find someway of contacting me to fill me in.

There are some of the issues I have discovered after receiving these and was not happy about. None of these issues I have seen in any review, unfortunately. I would have think twice then. Here are more details: 1. I bought these to use mostly for communication (90-95% of the time) as a replacement for my current ones Logitech G533. Microphone broke after 3+ years of using these pretty much for a whole day every day. 2. Had issues connecting my new Sony headphones with PC for a first time. It worked out only after 4th attempt. Process itself is quite annoying. I had to ask Google how do do this properly and check for a new driver. 3. After first connection they reconnect without any issues. Connection time after pressing power button is about 5 seconds. That works fine for me personally. 4. Sony headphones are displayed in sound manager as 2 separate devices - headset and headphones. See snapshot. 5. Headset - to be used for communication since only in this mode microphone is active. However, when you use them with a microphone the sound quality drops down. Moreover, if you listen to your music in \"headset\" mode, the sound quality will be terrible. This is how I turned them on for a very first time and was VEEEERY disappointed and wanted to send them back. 6. Headphones - this mode is meant for music listening. Sound quality is nice. I'd rate it \"A-\". Overall - works fine for me personally. Microphone cannot be used in this mode. 7. When you listen to the music and need to make/accept a call it requires switching between between these 2 devices. This is VERY ANNOYING and not convenient!!! SONY .... come on ))) You must be kidding me. 8. Microphone sound quality - my personal feeling is \"B-\". As for a built-in mic it's pretty decent. Do not compare it to a standalone mic. You cannot get the same quality. 9. Noise canceling - this works great, no doubts. Definitely A+ 10. Controls - volume, play/pause, next/previous all built-in in your right ear. No buttons, just touching/swiping. 11. 3.5 mm additional cable works fine as a backup if you battery suddenly dies. Sound quality still good. Mic does not works in this mode. 12. USB C for charging - great. 13. Headphones do not work when charging. This is a disappointment. It's not complicated feature to add. My old ones G533 worked fine even when charging. Mic was functional in that mode as well. That was a huge benefit. 14. Built-in mic is a benefit for me. Less mechanical parts - less chances to break them. 15. Folding into smaller form factor is a benefit. 16. Lightweight, flexible, soft cushions, nice feeling, nice looking. 17. Cushions size - I'd prefer these to be a little larger so they would NOT touch my ears. 18. BT range - connection is not good starting at ~ 17 feet in headset mode. 19. NO APP FOR WIN 10. SETTINGS ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE SAME WAY AS FOR ANDROID OR IOS DEVICES!!! Summary Sound quality is great if you buy them mostly to listen to the music. I'd recommend these. If you buy these mostly for phone calls at you PC - think twice! I'd NOT recommend these.

For more than 30 years I've been relying on them for my headphones and speakers because of the quality of sound delivery they provide. I say this because you need to understand that this review is coming from someone that appreciates what the company does well, rather than some butthurt customer looking to attack the company. These headphones provide great comfort. I have a very large head but the band still has more extension room than I require for a comfortable over-the-ear fit. They stay in place pretty well on my head. I don't know if that would be true for people with smaller heads or not, since the inward friction would be lower. The sleek design control scheme is novel. Instead of buttons on the headset, volume and action control happens from sliding a finger over the outside of the headset. Overall the design is great. However, I'm autistic and noise disturbance is a big problem for me. I ordered these headphones because I had to spend a month away from home in a place with constant disturbance and I needed the ability to control that. I ordered these specifically for the noise cancelling. The noise cancelling is almost completely non-functional. It cuts out perhaps the lowest 10% of auditory frequency and that's it. So it might cut out the hum of the fan across the room but not much else. When it comes to the sounds of conversation, music, television, etc, everything in the human communication range comes through just as loud with the noise cancelling on as with the headphones powered off. I needed noise cancelling headphones and these do not qualify. I had to turn around and order a set of Bose headphones. I'm very unhappy with the situation.

I am FAR from an audiophile both in budget I'll allow per headphones and also my critique of audio equipment but I recognize quality equipment (and poor equipment) pretty readily.  I will accept compromise when it makes sense to, etc.  I own quite a lot of headphones, but in this review I'll be doing comparisons against my top two which are my Panasonic HJE900's (in-ear buds, very neutral sound) and my AKG K545 over-ear (somewhat v shaped sound, not bassy, but not neutral like the HJE900's). My goal was to buy a do-it-all set of headphones from conference calls at the desk (bluetooth to my Linux desktop), music/entertainment at the desk, also music/calls on the phone.  I have a set of Hyper X Cloud II's that I use for conference calls at the desk and I find their sound quality quite good for what they are and the microphone is excellent but the cables are in the way all the time and it'd be nice to replace my use of the AKG's and the Cloud II's into a single device.  I don't quite think I'm there, but I'm still pretty happy.  I will update when I'm doing conference calls again after a break but I think things will be fine.  Onto the review. Pluses AAC, AptX, AptX HD, and LDAC will keep these headphones relevant for a long time.  I was always reluctant to buy any expensive bluetooth headphones because they would be out of date with old codecs as a2dp codecs improve over time, but these are good enough to not be concerned about what's coming.  I suspect in the future we'll see perhaps more efficient codecs, ones that are more resistant to drop-outs, maybe a headset profile that doesn't sound terrible, but these are just fine.  Seriously, why are bluetooth headset profiles still the same super-low bitrate defined 20 years ago for the very first bluetooth headsets? Bluetooth range is amazing, all my other headsets will cut out here and there in my (small) house but have never heard a single drop-out on this one, using LDAC.  Have not tested a range of \"can walk N feet from my phone\" but real world use it keeps up great.  Even out in the yard it drops out a time or two, which I suspect would be fine if I had my bluetooth dongle up higher.  It's currently plugged into a hub under my monitor. They are comfortable enough, but my ears are fairly big and my right ear feels like it's touching inside.  It's not enough to be uncomfortable but enough to notice.  So doesn't bother me, or hurt, or make me want to take them off..  but I do notice it sometimes. I am no audiophile, but I appreciate quality headphones.  I don't have any expensive ones, but I do have Panasonic HJE900 and AKG K545 as my best in-ear and best over-ear.  The HJE900's are very precise and and have a very flat sound profile, the K545's are pretty good with more of a V profile but far from a \"bassy\" headset.  The Sony 900N's, but being \"extra bass\" surprised me at first that they weren't as boomy as I was fearing they would be.  However I did fairly quickly drop them 2-3db across the bottom EQ ranges as certain tracks which I assume had more bass in them naturally got pretty boomy sounding.  Like Tommy from The Who is a very boomy album and these headphones hit pretty hard the whole time; I do have to EQ \"more\" on albums like this.  So overall I find them not obscenely bassy on most music, but some tracks/albums it's pretty overpowering.  So are these great headphones who want a really flat profile?  No.  Are they so boomy they aren't good for everyone else?  No to that as well; they're fine.  If EQ'ed, however.  If you can't EQ your music in some way these might be too overpowering if you don't like the bass. Besides that, I find the mid and high frequency reproduction to be fine, not as good as the HJE900's, almost as good as the K545's.  Soundstage is more cramped than both, however.  My K545's are closed back which seems like the two would be similar, but the 900N's are less wide a sound stage.  Channel-dynamic tracks like Pink Floyd etc are well separated, they sound fine but they do not have an open feel to them.  Something like the K545's the channels feel like they're originating a foot out from my ears, while the 900N's feel like it's a few inches. A lot of reviews on youtube comment obsessively over the \"feel\" of the plastic on the 900N's...  It's fine.  They are clearly thick and sturdy plastics and the feel of the plastic fine.  It's just different than the 1000N's seems to be the comparison.  I do not have 1000N's to compare, however. I've worn the headphones two days in a row a few times, no battery concerns, at all.  They don't charge super fast but I don't care; at the end of the second day the battery was \"about 50%\" so I plugged them in.  As for the battery info; I've heard it's very limited in what the battery levels will report which is a shame.  I suspect Sony was afraid they couldn't give exact numbers so they reduced the granularity, but I prefer to recharge batteries before they drop below 25% or so and it would be nice to at least have 10% battery granularity. The ambient modes are pretty handy.  I've only used them in the house to talk to the wife but it feels like it'd be great for users who work in an office and need to hear their surroundings for a moment or all the time, but other times need to block out the world.  Touching the right cup is a very quick way to emable ambient mode and I've left the Custom button toggling between the ambient and noise-cancelling modes. I've never owned any noise cancelling headphones as the ones I've heard in the past distorted everything, including the music, and still let in a bunch of ambient sound in.  No idea what I had tested in the past, but these are a very different beast.  My computer fans completely disappear.  Road noise in the car completely disappears.  I have not been on a train, plane, etc, but I imagine they'd be great there too.  And if you need to hear what's going on around you, Sony offers 20 levels of ambient noises.  Honestly not sure that 20 is very useful, but it's there if you need it.  You can only flip between Noise Cancelling on, Noise Cancelling + Ambient Sound Mode, or Ambient Sound Mode off.  The first two cut out most low noises but allow voices etc in, and can be adjusted in the app to what level of noises it allows in.  The third mode turns off all Noise Cancelling altogether.  The headphones have pretty good noise isolation of their own, as would be expected for them to be able to block noise. I have not nor really intend to use them with a 3.5mm plug, but it is there if you need it.  My understanding is they are usable with the 3.5mm plug with the headset off, but of course no Noise Cancelling and I've seen a few things say the audio quality isn't as good as with the headset off there's no preamp on in the headset. But they work in a pinch.  I imagine you could charge them while you use them on 3.5mm, but you can not use them on Bluetooth and charge at the same time. If you want a good set of headphones for silence; ie:  purely blocking noise, no music, etc, I can't really speak to that either.  I would think that a good set of isolating headphones would do that job better but not sure. Minor nits/picks The touch is a bit over sensitive sometimes, just moving the headphones or getting hair out of my way I sometimes skip tracks by accident. Since these are noise blocking and attach solidly to your head, you do need to put them on and take them off fairly slowly.  They will actually push/pull on your eardrum a little.  I can feel it just a tad when I take them off, but it's not uncomfortable. Disappointments Can't connect between Phone and Desktop at the same time, at all.  My Fiio BTR3 will stay connected to my desktop playing music and stay connected to my phone and play music from it if I pause the desktop.  It will auto switch between the two without me doing anything which is great.  It will also take over for phone calls so even if I'm listening to music on the desktop and I get a phone call the phone will take priority.  I have to manually disconnect for the 900N's to connect to either.  You can pair up to 10 devices, so it's not a huge deal, but having to manually disconnect from one, manually connect to another..  Is a bit annoying.  It will always connect to the last device it was connected to by default like most bluetooth devices do. I have yet to get the Google Assistant to do anything except tell me the time.  I press and hold the button and say something and it says \"Sorry\".  Not sure what I am doing wrong here, but I've given up on it and reassigned the button back to ambient sound control.  It's also a real shame that Sony couldn't figure out a way to allow the user to control both functions.  It's either Ambient Sound control, or Assistant controls.  Another button or some other gesture on the right ear perhaps would have worked."}, {"date": "2020-12-29", "score": 0.952, "review": "The best feature for me is that they go over my ears.

When those inevitably wore out after I think two years, I looked right back to this line of headphones, and found these. After ordering them I immediately found the noise canceling and the better shape very good additions, the noise canceling makes for a far more immersive experience when listening to nearly anything. The bluetooth connection has been very intuitive and unfailing, occasionally when I pair to a new device (this includes using the pair function to connect to previously paired devices) the volume will be much lower than the volume level indicator tells me, but a quick off/on fixes that. The shape around the ears is tight, and if the headphones are tilted too far back or forward it can irritate the ears after a while, but they do not drift and I almost always put them on at the right tilt without thinking about it.

These headphones do get a little uncomfortable for me after about an hour of use, so if you know that you have a pretty big head then I would suggest you take that into account, and if you're not sure then you probably don't have to worry about it.

Hence, I was looking forward to another solid purchase but this is a BIG time disappointment from Sony. Bought this over Christmas sale and have been using it for ~3 months now. Pros: > The sound quality is OK. > Wireless bluetooth has a decent range and works well. > Battery life is decent. Cons: > The sound quality is underwhelming for the price you are paying. > There is a \"microphone\" in a sense that it's there but it doesn't actually work for realistic usage. Every video conference I have attended using this pair of headphones begins with everyone in the call complaining that the audio from my end is muffled, too soft or inaudible. More often, people can't hear you at all. > The build quality is extremely cheap and plasticy. The joints creak with the lightest touch and swivel. Especially when you click the buttons. The XB-650BT back then was miles ahead in terms of quality. > The charge time is too long but I understand that this might be more of a limitation on battery tech. > The headphones don't remember your Sony Connect equalizer settings when you switch devices but this might just be my setup (iPhone + PC). > The headphones default to Noise cancelling every time you turn them on. It's annoying if you use the ambient sound setting or if you don't want either of the noise cancelling or ambient sound effects as you have to toggle them every time you turn the device on. > The product includes a wired option but there it doesn't relay signals from the mic on your headphones.

It hurts my ears after a while and it completely demolishes the sound quality. I would rather sit with them turned off to try to mask the sound of people moving and talking around me than deal with the static they produce.
