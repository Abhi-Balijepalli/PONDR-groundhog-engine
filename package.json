Now onto the sole reason why I removed two stars. I would rate my head as being average in size. That being said, this is the most ungodly uncomfortable pair of headphones I have ever worn, period. It's presses around the ears very tightly, particularly towards the bottom of the ear cups. Compared to the Cloud Stinger, which I can wear as if it's not even on my head, I have to take this pair off every 10 minutes just from how absurdly uncomfortable it is. Of course, some people may not have this problem. It might fit perfectly fine for them. However, it's likely that I will be returning these from the sheer discomfort I have experienced.

Other than this design flaw, it's a good headset and of good sound quality for the price.

I unplugged and plugged in again.  I made sure the plug was inserted correctly.  I'm returning them.  I've already ordered a different headset (rushed delivery) coming this evening.

The price point is pretty impossible to beat for everything you get with the headset. The surround sound is a little trippy, but after using them for a little bit I can definitely see how beneficial the 7.1 surround sound can be. Listening to 8D audio is enhanced further with this headset. The best part about the headset is they work out of the box, but you can download drivers (software) to better suit the headset to what you are using them for (e.g. gaming, music, etc.).
