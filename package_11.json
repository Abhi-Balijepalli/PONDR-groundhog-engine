It took a few times of practice before he \"got\" it. It did work best unbuckling one strap at a time, for his tiny little hands.  I am sure as he grows and has more practice it will be like second nature to him. Bucklebee is made of a nice thick material, and I have no worries of it breaking.

As soon as I received it, I put it on my 4 year old's Britax car seat, it fit right into place in about 15-30 seconds. I strapped in the 4 year old and told him to try to unbuckle the car seat himself. Within 5 seconds he had popped open the bottom latch and unbuckled the top which he already knew how to do. If you saw the surprise and smile on his face you would buy the product just to see your child's reaction. Now whenever we get to our destination he pops open the buckles and waits at the door for us to open it for him. You never realize how much something so simple can add to your quality of life. My wife was so happy she asked me to order one for each of the cars and for the grandparents car. I was so happy I actually reached out to the designers to tell them thank you, something I had never done before. In summary, if you child can unbuckle the top buckle, then with this product they can also unlatch the bottom buckle. It is simple and safe.

It is absurdly easy to slip it on the belt under the buckle, and just press up to release.  It is wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, and has changed everything for me in my attitude towards taking my grandson different places.....because I can get him out! The company goes to great lengths to warn users that the child in the seat must be responsible enough not to release themselves while you are driving, and I appreciate these warnings.  If my grandson decides he will experiment in the future, it will be no problem to keep the Bucklebee up front and just slip it on his seat belt when I need to get him out.

It shouldn't effect a warranty or interfere with the safety features of the car seat itself. This is no different from other baby products such as mirrors or toys that attach to the handle.

While the video depicts a very easy use of this product, I must admit that I had some issues in using it at first, but I finally mastered it.  Here are some tips that I learned while trying to master the Bucklebee so that it operates more smoothly for any other buyers of the Bucklebee. *First of all, make sure that the seat belt fits snuggly on your child. *Secondly, if the Bucklebee fits loosely and slides up and down easily on the seat belt itself, make sure your child or grandchild slides the Bucklebee up to the base of the buckle lock with one hand, and operates the Buclebee lock release with \"both\" hands to unbuckle. *Lastly, be sure that the Bucklebee is being used straight and flat and \"not\" being turned or twisted sideways to be released.  This will make it hard for your child or grandchild to release the seat belt because it will not be an even preasure for both seat belts to release on the 5 point restraint at the same time.

We had a diono and my daughter (age 4 when she was able to do it first) was able to unbuckle it pretty easily. The button is a little larger and I think it had just been broken in after 4 years. She was able to push and then wiggle it free. We just purchased a britax frontier and I could tell From when i tried undoing it.. it would be more difficult. The button is smaller and you had to push it \"just right\" to get it free. I installed this and she has ZERO issues getting it unbuckled. I love that it stays attached to the seat belt and it's just one simple maneuver to get it on the button. I think with the way she has to hold it to get it to move in, it's just a natural position for her to hold the back of the buckle in place and then use her thumbs to do that extra force to engage it. She then wiggles it a little and it's done.

So I tried this in a 2015 Toyota Avalon and 2014 Honda Odyssey driven by a combat driver with a weighted doll (think: EMT training tool/CPR dummy). Regardless of the hard stops (60mph rapid deceleration; 25mph sharp turn LF and RT; short stops), rapid acceleration (0-60; 30-60; 0-25 hairpin LF and RT) and weaving with braking the buckle did not release. HOWEVER, once my 5 year old was in the seat, he immediately was able to use the Bucklebee. This means two things: 1. I am responsible for my childs safety and whether he is ready to use this (that whole being accountable and parenting responsibilities concept) 2. We needed to practice this process and ensure he was prepared. So we did and all was well. No problems (didnt even need to adjust the straps). I didnt find five dollars. My story is anticlimactic because the Bucklebee works well but doesnt create problems. Be responsible, talk to your kids and it will work well.

I was looking at a different brand that does not stay on, you need to slip it on and off to use it and Im glad I chose this instead!! The car seats usually come with a sleeve that goes around the buckle to protect the crotch area and I always found it cumbersome because it always got in the way when buckling them in.  It would prevent the buckle from seating/clicking and was always just a pain to have to pull the sleeve out of the way.  When installed, This is placed perfectly to keep the sleeve low and out of the way. That in itself is a win in my book!! I can now easily and effortlessly push the button to unbuckle her with one hand and simultaneously pull the buckle downwards and the belts just pop out!! Its great for grandparents who dont have a lot of strength, great for anyone with limited dexterity, for parents who always have their hands full and could use a one handed helper to slip the buckle out, or for kiddos who are big enough to get themself out on their own.

We bought a Recaro harness-to-booster to replace an Evenflo car seat we had in our other car because my child outgrew it in height, that one they can unbuckle themselves too.  Both of the kids are tall and heavy enough to ride on regular backless boosters with car seat belts but we want to keep them secured in harnesses as long as possible.  We recently bought a Graco Atlas harness-to-booster for the 3 yr old because we got a great deal on it, and upon testing it out, discovered that the button on that seat is not the same square button as on mostit is a round button and is much harder to push. It took more effort from my fingers and even my 5 yr old couldn't release it to help their sibling out. This may be a good thing for some kids who are too young to know when it's OK to unbuckle and have super strong hands and can unbuckle themselves, but for us it was an inconvenience.  So much so that I thought about returning the Graco car seat, but then I remembered I'd seen this thing on Facebook or somewhere and decided to get it. I wasn't sure if it would work with the circular button, but it did.  We only slide the outside part of the belt (it's dual layer on most seats) under the bucklebee so it doesn't interfere with the car seat in any way or cause any discomfort, and my 3 yr old is now able to squeeze it onto the circular buckle to get enough torque to release the belt.  Also, it's bright yellow color makes it easy to see in the dark and helps in placing the strap forward and trying to avoid sitting on it when they climb into the seat, for easier access to it once they are sitting and trying to buckle. Having kids that can get in and out of car seats on their own is liberating.  Obviously you check to make sure they are properly buckled and the chest strap is where it should be each time, but IF you have kids whom you trust with buckling/unbuckling themselves because they're old enough and you've talked with them about the dangers of not being buckled and your kids never unbuckle themselves unless it's time to, then this will help their little hands be able to unbuckle the bottom.  If they can't unbuckle the top chest clip then this won't save you any time, so you're not ready for this yet. It saved us from having to return our new car seat.  (because we were not going to go back to the days of unbuckling a kid after having lived the good part of a year enjoying the easiness of getting in and out of cars, and because our kids enjoyed the freedom and confidence they used to have and were getting more frustrated than me with the new car seat)"}, {"date": "2016-03-12", "score": 0.926, "review": "My 5 year old loves it.

My 4 year old has just started to use this product in her new forward facing car seat (Cosco Finale) and it will be great to be able to keep her in the harness and use the drive-line for Kindergarten next year.

I bought two, because this item had lower reviews and I wanted to make sure what I got worked.  But I loved the idea that the buckle bee stays on the seatbelt latch and doesnt have to be stored on a keychain or in a door pocket. Tried the other one first-  it worked but was such a pain to get around the bulky lower buckle latch that I knew it wasnt going to work for my kids. I have three kids and we just found out were having twins! So its VITAL that my older ones can get my toddler out on their own lol. With that in mind, I pulled out the buckle bee next and put it on the lower latch belt- super easy, even with my car seat latch being very bulky. WORKS LIKE A CHARM. Even my toddler can operate it when shes told to! I love this thing- dont know why other versions of unbuckle helpers are even purchased instead. The plastic is thicker and seems more resilient than the other (very popular) product I tried, its super cute with the little bee, and you dont have to take it off and store (and lose) it! Unless you need to for a toddler that can do it themselves at inopportune times! ;) as a disclaimer, my kids are unusually highly coordinated ;)) lol! Super stoked about this Buckle Bee and will definitely recommend!", "worst_review": "Taking five minutes to push the button to release your kid? Not anymore!!! This this is a must!
