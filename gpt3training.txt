My only complaint and its my fault.. Make sure you measure. the box it came in was so large the delivery men could not get it down my basement, and i paid extra for that. Also they wont take it out of the box..  Now i had to pay some one else to remove it from the box and it was fine.  Very easy to put together, strong, a really nice table.......
We received a text in the time frame we selected the delivery team was on the way. Two folks in a Amazon truck showed up and unloaded the ping pong and first thing we looked over together was the box. It was very heavily wrapped and had cardboard inserts on all four sides to protect the table. It was easy to un box and the instructions were very easy to understand. Just need a socket wrench and another wrench. I was able to assemble the table in about 25 mins. It takes two people to flip the two sides over and the kids were playing in under 30 mins. Very happy with the whole experience. First time buying something on Amazon this size and it worked out great. Its also a high quality table. You won't be disappointed.
We love this table.  Bought for my husband who had a stroke and doesn't want to exercise but can play ping pong very well.  We play for an hour at least 4 days a week in one side of our 2 car garage with the door down - don't have to chase balls as far. It is great exercise for a 76yr old and the table has held up extremely well for 2 months with a lot of playing time.  It is also very easy to fold and put away when needed.  The table comes in 2 sections and the net is clamped on holding the 2 sections together. Would recommend this to anyone.  Even though it isn't an indoor outdoor table you could easily roll it out on a nice day.
I scheduled delivery for Friday morning, 9/30 and they showed up on Wednesday afternoon, 9/28. I was out of town but I was able to open the garage door remotely for delivery. The table was packaged in one heavy box. I opened the box and I was able to handle the two main pieces on my own. The only assembly was to attach the wheel sections so it was easy to assemble. The net is also easy to assemble and disassemble. A couple of the plastic end caps were loose but I pushed them back into the metal tubing. The tabletop had one small scuff that is barely noticeable. The table is heavy-duty and my family really enjoys playing it.
Bought this as a surprise for the kids. Unfortunately the delivery was messed up but not going to rate negatively because of that. The table was real easy to put together and I had it setup in a just a few minutes. My wife and I played for an hour or so right way..lol Kids love playing so it has been a great addition. I didn't rate folding or maneuverability because we've left it in the same spot.
Very happy about this Christmas present I got my boys. Almost all ping pong tables require at least an hour of assembly, I went from boxed to fully assembled in 8 minutes in Christmas Eve. The surface of the table was and has remained perfect. Folding the table up is very simple that my 9 yearold can do it. The table is always in two separate halves, regardless if it is down (playable) or folded up. You simply push the two halves together and the net clips clip overlap both pieces. I've been thrilled how convenient it is to fold and move. For family playing purposes we will never need a "nicer" or thicker table top. This works great for destroying your young children in ping pong.
I was just looking for a ping pong table to keep my 4 kids (ages 10-18) entertained during this quarantine and off their multiple screens. This sturdy table was assembled easily (by my husband obviously) and has been the subject of MANY tournaments already. I bought this particular table because other similar tables had awful reviews of arriving damaged. This table was packaged well with more than cardboard, but was still able to maneuver down our steep basement steps and arrived in flawless condition (for now :)) The delivery driver communicated well about the timing of delivery as well as called 20min before arrival. Normally this would be a big deal with our busy lives, but let's face it, we have been home for WEEKS (hence the need for the table). I can't comment on the durability as we just got it, but it looks like it will prove sturdy enough for our needs. Definitely recommend highly!
Shopping online for an indoor ping pong table we compared the STIGA and Joola models.  We need a strong table since we have four boys who are often rough on their possessions.  We also wanted one we could easily move out of the way to open up the room for other uses.  And of course we wanted to keep the price down. We found it very difficult to compare the steel supports of the various models because Amazon (and other retailers' web sites) seemed to include contradictory dimensions in the product specs.  In the end we chose the STIGA Advantage model because of good online reviews of the brand, because  it was beefier than the Advantage Lite, and because we weren't prepared to pay even more for the Advantage Pro. The table arrived with some very noticeable damage to one corner of the box (i.e. a 2 inch diameter hole with some visible particle board dust).  Obviously, this was a problem with the shipping company.  However, we were pleased that when we got the box open the only damage to the table was a very slight (1/16" x 3/4") "pinch" of the underside corner of table that is not visible and does not affect play at all. Assembly was much easier than I expected.  It took probably 10 minutes to attach the four pairs of caster wheels.  Be aware, it does take two people to flip the table sections over and stand them up on their wheels. The table sections roll  well and can be maneuvered easily by a single person around the room or down the hall.  Raising and lowering the sections is simple and doesn't require much strength, but you need to pay close attention to unlocking the angled supports before you lift (I expect we will soon forget that and bend those supports). Attaching the net was straightforward and quite quick.  I am curious whether the string used to tension the net will hold up (it seems like it could break pretty easily). We are very novice players, but it seems to us the ball bounces well on the surface.  NOTE: the table does not come with paddles or balls. As far as the steel supports go, I am definitely glad we got this model over the Advantage Lite.  I already caught one son sitting on the table (big surprise), and if money was no object I might have chosen the Advantage Pro model.  This is not a criticism of the table, just an observation in case anyone else is considering a table purchase for a house full of tween/teen boys. It is still early days so we'll have to see how well this holds up in the long run, but we are very happy with it at the start.
I can count on 2 fingers the number of critical reviews I've given in 15 years.  Avoid buying from this distributor, Escalade Sports.  The table is great...if they had only mailed it with a net.  Upon my call, they assured me it would be sent "overnight" and arrive on the 23rd.  On the 29th the new net arrives, which is 1/2 the width of a ping pong table.  I will be sure to call tomorrow between 10-3pm...the only hours they answer their phone.
This is a good high-quality table tennis table. It met all my expectations. It took about 30 minutes to assemble the table and we were up and playing. Tabletop has a nice finish. The packaging was good and mine had no scratches. I also paid an extra $20 to be delivered in the game room. This table is heavy and it is worth the cost.
The product is excellent. The surface is nice and solid. Installation is really easy and takes 10 minutes or less. It can be very easily handled. The two pieces are separate so each one is not too heavy. There are also wheels so you can easily lift one side and move it everywhere. the net that comes with it seems to be very good as well.
Great ping pong table for home use. I decided to save money and bought the lite version but wish I bought the advantage only because I think its more substantial and will hold up better since we play almost everyday. The table thickness is my main concern but its great for now! Noticed some screws on the underside of the deck backing themselves out after only a couple weeks of use but no issues yet. Great table
This is my third purchase of this table. The thing I like most is that it's very easy to assemble. Out of the box, put 8 bolts on it, and ready to play! Products are packaged very carefully to minimize any possibility of making scratches on surface. Yet it has protection rubbers at 4 corners to avoid any chipping on edges. Surfaces are very clean, flat, and well-coated. Balls bounce well and sounds clear. When done, again easy to fold to store it in a minimal space. Durability is great as the first one is over 2 years now without any issues. One bonus: it comes with a decent, height-adjustable net!
Well made, quality, and sturdy.  Lovely color and surface. So much better than the table I grew up with. And a life saver during the pandemic. A great family sport.
Came on time, took about 15 minutes to assemble (with help from my daughter). You need a spanner to tighten the bolts and it wasn't included in the packaging. The table feels sturdy and good quality and we already had hours of fun
Hard to contact company about time and date of delivery, then when you get someone your happiness is short lived because they are nasty and seem not to know company policies or how they can help. Finally delivery day and delivery guy is nasty too Have a good ping pong  day
Arrived perfect, great packaging.  Great design and quality and easy, quick storage and take-down.  I COULD NOT BE MORE IMPRESSED!
This table has replaced a table top set up we had over a pool table. The build quality is real solid, easy to fold and the net is easy to assembly and adjust. I am very happy with this purchase.
I've been wanting a ping pong table for a long time but was worried about storage space.  I chose the STIGA because of it's nesting capability to reduce storage size.  I was a bit nervous when it was delivered because the two delivery men were talking about how heavy it was.  But my fears were unfounded as I easily assembled it in just a few minutes and was playing table tennis right away.  Tables have come a long way since I owned one 20 years ago and I love this one.  The table top is solid (heavy) but since they are two separate pieces, it's much easier to move around.  The clip on net is easy to assemble and use to hold the two halves of the table together.  Would definitely recommend.
For years we owned Stiga's top-of-the-line ping pong table and absolutely loved it.  I still regret selling it when we moved cross country.  This time around we bought the Advantage table, Stiga's table for everyday users.  My wife loves the table because it is blue, as opposed to green.  I could care less about the color.  It is a great ping pong table.  Assembly was super easy, folding the table upright is super easy, rolling the table into an adjoining room (which we often do) is super easy, and best of all, it is significantly lighter than their competition table.  I have nothing but good things to say/write about this table.  I doubt I'd consider any other table than a Stiga.
It was surprisingly easy to assemble as advertised. Basically you just put on the wheels, and you are done. The shipping box was much thinner and more compact than I imaged when it arrived. I thought they had more parts to unload from the truck and was waiting, but the two guys left after they unloaded a single box to my garage. Had I known that it was only one box, I would have asked them to move it to my basement directly. I asked a neighbor to help me move the table to basement later. Not super heavy when lifting one half a time. Other than that, I'm totally happy with this table. It looks professional and I have enjoyed playing ping-pong on this table so far.
I bought this table based on all the other great reviews.  I was a little concerned the table may get damaged in shipping due to the weight, but they pack it so well it got to me in perfect condition.  A friend helped me set this up and it only took us about 10 to 15 minutes.  The quality of the table is very high.  The clip on net is also really nice compared to the nets I played on in the past. I'm glad I went with this table and didn't go with something cheaper.  At the same time I am glad I didn't buy a more expensive table as the quality is already so good on this one.
This Stiga table was received this morning, packaged very nicely in one box.  Delivery from Amazon was excellent.  You can tell Stiga cares enough to pack the product with sufficient protection.  No issues with scratches on the playing surface as we sent a competitors new table back for that very reason.  Yes, it's very heavy, but also a sign of quality build.  It assembled in no time at all, plays sweet and looks great as well.  Cannot speak to durability yet but my expectations are high, since the design with ease of assembly is very well thought out.  The net went on in less than a minute; the table has a solid feel and stays put on the hardwood floor.
This is very high quality table, worth of very penny. It cost me about 15 minutes to assemble it. When the ball drops on the table, it makes a very pleasing sound, and make me feel I am a ping-pong pro. It brings a lot of fun to my family. Definitely a recommendation.
The table on time just like I was expecting it was in pretty decent shape but ,the only thing after paying that much for the table,should at least in cloud a pair of racquets and some ball in the package will make a lot sens other than that everything looks pretty decent l love it ,I can't to go to walmart to buy the racquets and some balls and I will be good to go.
I was ready to buy a table double the price of this one but glad I saved the money! Solid and easy to assemble. Like the blue color as a change of pace. My son uses the basement for many things so I was looking for something easy to get out of the way. This does the trick and splits in 2. My wife uses one of the half's to wrap Christmas presents on and we were planning on using it as a table when we have a big group over for dinner. The best part is the ping pong. There are no Forest Gump's in our family but we are a competitive bunch so it's fun to get away from the TV, PS4, etc. and have a good night of ping pong.
Very happy with this table so far.  It was packaged well (sat in my garage for almost a year, and was small enough to not be in the way).  Assembly was not quite the "10 minutes" advertised, but was pretty easy and only took about 30 mins with interruptions by kids.  Surface is solid and smooth, net is very easy to attach and adjust.  The table halves do not attach to each other outside of the net holders, which was a little of a surprise to me, and why I rated only 4/5 for Maneuverability.  I recommend this table.
Very nice table.  Easy to assemble for one person and folds and moves easy.  Very pleased with product.
This was a present for my dad for Christmas and we've been playing it nonstop , he's been impressed with the quality, the bounce and net are great, table is fully stable and easy to setup, you can break it down or get it ready to play in less than 2 minutes. My mom was happy with the blue top she likes it more than the green. The quality is great to me because it's all metal other than the table top, love it.
I have this TT table for the 6 months now, this is a great product, very sturdy and super easy n quick to fold amd stowaway in my basement mechanical room when I dont use it. Played many games with friends on this TT table, everyone likes it. I will give a full thumbs up for this one.
I bought this as a  birthday gift for my husband. I was going to pay a little less and get a table that had 4 panels to put together BUT it was worth paying more for the easy set up of 2 panels. We had it set up and were playing within in 15-20 mins of opening it up! It's is easy to fold up and down. We have been enjoying hours of fun with this table! We keep it in our garage and are constantly folding it up and down. No problems so far. Lots of fun for the whole family.
It's a nice table, not too difficult to set up. The one issue is that the screws keep popping out, probably 10 of them so far. These are not the screws we put in, but the ones that were holding the pre-attached parts. The table material is too soft and the screws don't hold, so I had to put some epoxy on the screws so they stay in place. This became a problem with the latch mechanism on the back; it fell off when the screws came out, and the strong spring on the back prevents it from being screwed/glued back on, at least as far as I could figure out.
Ok, I know there are more expensive tables out there however, for 500 balloons, this was a stretch for me to spend on a Ping Pong Table. Also, I am not sure what else you get for 250, 500, or 1,000 more Simoleons. Anyway, this thing weighs a ton so you better make some friends to move this baby.
The ping-pong table functions quite well.  Delivery was timely, but the table had to be left in our garage. The movers wanted an additional $50 to move it to our basement. We had to hire other movers (for $25) because it was too heavy to move ourselves, even in two pieces. Also, the table was damaged in shipping.  Nothing serious, but a support arm that was rather dented, and chipped paint on one side of the table, where the edge of the table is marked in white. Impossible to say exactly when or where that damage occurred, but it occurred during shipping because we saw the damage after unboxing it, before we moved it to our basement.
As my first table, I cannot compare to other tables. But, I CAN tell you that for the amateur to intermediate Table tennis player this is definitely worth its price. Since I received this table, I have played for about 1-2 hours a day in my garage. I have been improving rapidly, making the experience more fun. Pros- Easy to store (reasonably small and can be collapsed in less than a minute) Fun (hours of enjoyment) Good quality Easy to set up out of the box (10 minutes with 2 adults) STIGA website has lots of resources to help you become a better player (drills and technique videos) Cons- Size needed to enjoy a game. (19 by 11 feet minimum) This shouldn't prevent you from buying this table, all the tables are the same size, just a con for Table tennis in general Supports are a little small. (They aren't crazy thin, but it would be peace of mind to have thicker supports.) Needs two people to have a fun game (Again a con for table tennis in general) This table can convert in to a one person game where you hit it against the wall, but after a little bit it gets boring. The two halves of my table aren't the same height. At the net, one side is down by about 1/2 an inch. This isn't that bad because the net clamps bring them together, but still a little annoying. All in all, for the starting Table Tennis player, this is a great buy.
I just assembled my Stiga and I was impressed with the quality of the parts, the accuracy and simplicity of the instructions, and the ease with which it all went together. It is in our finished basement and thank goodness I tipped the delivery people to carry it around back and into my glass sliding doors. I don't know the exact weight but my wife and I would never have been able to carry it. It is a piece of cake to collapse it up into a storage position or a solo play option or return it to return it to the playing configuration. So far I am thrilled with the purchase and would strongly recommend it.
Not much I can say that hasn't been said by other reviewers. From ordering to set-up, the whole process couldn't have been easier. It was so convenient being able to choose the delivery schedule. There were lots of available time slots. The shipping company called a few days in advance to remind of us of the delivery window. I think they then called the day before. The driver called the day of when he was about 30 minutes out. Plus shipping was free!! As other have said, hardest part of set up was getting the table to where it needed to be - in the basement. But it wasn't too bad. We unboxed it in the garage and brought it down piece by piece. Actual set-up was super easy. I could have done it myself. I was also impressed with how it was packaged. The cardboard box was reinforced and there were hard plastic corner protectors on each corner of the table. The table, frame and legs are very sturdy and well-made. The top is a beautiful blue. We've never owned a ping pong table because we didn't have the space. We moved a few weeks ago into a bigger house and this was our first major purchase! I think this table will be a great investment for our family. Looking forward to spending time together over the upcoming holidays getting competitive!
The net supplied with the table, is way too small for the table + extension caused by the clamps, as such it sits way high and keeps causing the clamps to come off. The net has no string, no mechanism for adjustment. I've been calling their customer service for last one month to only be told, that they'll ship a replacement net, which has not happened over last 1 month of follow ups. Table itself is okay for the price.
I just finished assembling the new Stiga table in our garage. The only thing needed to be assembled were the 4 legs with casters while the table (each half) is turned up side down. It took less then half an hour to get the table ready for play. I really like how easy it is to maneuver the table around after assembling the legs. Also folding the 2 halves upright is a breeze when storing.
Excellent table for the money.  Great value!  Assembly was extremely simple. We were playing within 10 minutes of carrying the two sides down to our basement.  The quality of this table is much higher than I expected for this price.  A BIG improvement over our old table.  It folds easily and rolls smoothly.  When our kids play board games with friends they use one half of this table for a perfect gaming table.  Couldn't be happier with our purchase.
I haven't played ping pong since college (30 years ago) and decided to get a table so my wife and I could play.  When I started looking at my options I knew that I wanted a nice quality table that would fold up to store it away.  This is a solid and extremely sturdy table.  It weighs over 200 pounds so plan on having some help moving and unboxing it.  We are very please with our decision and would highly recommend this table.
I did a good amount of research prior to purchasing this table... durability, looks, and ease of set-up were the three most important criteria. This table is a "10" on all three attributes... wow - easy to set-up (quick and painless) The table is incredibly sharp looking and sturdy. Highly recommend. And... I ordered this table on a Friday evening... it was delivered on Monday morning (quick!!!).
The box itself was extremely heavy. It absolutely requires two people to move it plus a dolly...unless youre crazy like and and move it by yourself and almost hurt yourself in the process....assembly literally took less than 30 min from start to finish....the table is top quality and is being enjoyed by our entire family! Should have bought this (I mean Santa should have brought this) years ago!!!!
This is christmas gift for my son. We received it as per the timeline mentioned on the website. The packaging was good and there were no scratches or dents. It is heavy and sturdy. It took no more than 15 minutes once we have the right tools, and the required tools are minimal to set up. The best feature I luke is the foldability of the table and moving aside when not playing which saves a lot of space even in smaller houses. Also, folding one half of the table enables you to play just by yourself when no partner is available to play. The rollers along with brakes are perfect to hold the table in place when playing and both the halves matches exactly. The net and clamps are very good quality ones. We have been playing on this table for the past 2 days and very satisfied so far.
I do like Stiga and had originally bought the Sitga Advantage and now I bought the Stiga Advantage Lite as a gift. I was happy with the quality of both. For those wondering what's the difference: The first thing I noticed is the Lite is a 2 piece table. What's nice about that is you can fold and roll them away as two pieces, so storage is easy (something I was looking for). It comes pretty much assembled, you just include the wheels. Overall, gets 5 Stars for Quality, Price, and Installation.
Couldn't be happier with our ping pong table. Came packaged very thoroughly and without incident. Table was a snap to put together--easy!  We use our room for lots of things and being able to fold with ease is a big benefit. Also like how one person can practice. The table is very sturdy and I sure like the blue. Just remember to purchase your paddles and balls separately.
Great table. I gave it 5 stars because it deserves it. One of the categories for stars is maneuverability and I have it 5 stars for that, because the wheels work well and it folds easily, but this is a big table, in two distinct sections so its easy to maneuver for what it is, but its still a big big piece of furniture. Very happy and very satisfied with the purchase. I dont anticipate needing another one of these, ever, but if I did, I would buy this one again!
I have to say that after reading previous reviews I was decided to get this table. This is my first table tennis and I'm hoping that this will last me a while. I bought this table to have fun with family and friends. The setup was very straightforward and easy, I was able to put this table together by my self in less than 20 minutes. It is very well packaged and it is protected by plastic corner ends as well as particle board side frame. The cardboard box is backed by a very thin but very strong particle board. Shipping was excellent always on time like any other Amazon shipment. It was free delivery so you can't beat that. The box is very heavy and it would be difficult for a single person to move. The delivery guys left it inside my garage just as I asked them and they laid it down flat for the easier unboxing. Over all I'm very pleased with it.
Great table, great packaging and easy assembly and storage.  OK, it is not a tournament table (costing 10X as much) but it is a really great table for the price.  True bounce, solid materials. Assembly is a breeze and it separates and folds up quickly--about three minutes. Hint:  Keep and cut up the cardboard the table was packaged in.  Perfect for keeping your TT balls corralled while you play.
Gorgeous design, easy to assemble and well priced. I just wanted a table to play with my teenage sons during corona virus. At first I thought about ordering the outdoor version, but we decided the indoor tables make a nicer sound. We set up in our garage and have been playing everyday. It came within days, was perfectly packed, and is everything I was hoping for. Perfect. Comes with table and net. Easy to fold and also play against yourself. Must order your own paddles and balls. $400, I dont think you can beat the quality to price.
For the price it's great, very easy to assemble (although would have helped if there were instructions), also very portable and light so if you have to store it somewhere else it's very convenient. Although, I initially feel the bounce is not as true as the STIGA STS 420 (that I previously had at work).
This product was purchased for our kids as a Christmas gift. It's a great table however, it's extremely heavy. It was super easy to assemble and maneuver around our basement. Should last a long time. Delivery with amazon was a hassle and didn't arrive as it should have being a Prime item but it eventually came. Also, the delivery people did not follow instructions to bring the table inside even though delivery was scheduled for a specific time so someone was home.
Well built and easy to assemble.  This table has stood up to hours of fun with my family.  Having it delivered straight my rec room door was quite handy also.
Extremely easy to assemble, like said 95% pre-assembled; feet are a bit mumbling but easy to move it around once assembled; very clean cut and sturdy table; playability is perfect; great added value entertainment for one to four people; felt really healthy once we got this and playing an hour a day at least! Highly recommend!
I looked at many offerings from different makers and found this table to be my choice, based on the following: From it's description, it is pleasing to the eye, the materials seem to be quality and the price was right.  After receiving the table, it was easy to assemble, sturdy and proven quality.  I'm happy with the purchase and sure to have many fun times playing!  The only drawback was the delivery; had to pay the deliverymen to take the table to the basement ( couldn't have done it alone).  Original delivery option was to the front door or garage.  Yet I still feel it deserves the highest rating.
This is a good table for indoor use and relatively easy to fold up and move out of the way to store it when not in use.  The product arrived in good packaging with no damage.  We had someone assemble it for us and with the right tools and knowledge it was less than 30 minutes from removing from packaging to ready to play.  The only problem with the table is that the white string at the top of the net which is used to tighten the net when needed is not long enough to fasten on the net base per the instructions.  The net appears plenty tight so dont perceive this to be a major problem. Im sure well have lots of family fun with this table.
One star for quality and customer service. Bought it two months ago. The rolling wheel broke after a couple of usages. Contacted customer service and got a ticket number. Radio science for more than a week now. Update: finally got the reply from support, saying they will ship out the damaged parts.
We are really enjoying the table; a big upgrade over our last one.  Excellent bounce, fairly easy set up, and great product support.
I was skeptical about buying an item like this online. But once it arrived my worries were all subsided. This table was un-damaged and easy to put together. With in minutes my wife and I were playing ping pong. The table is made of good quality and its easy to play on. Its a very nice looking table and my whole family has enjoyed it. So far I have not been beaten.
We love Stiga Pingpong table, it was delivered on time to the hour scheduled time. It is easy to assemble and can be stored away folding up without taking much of space.  We, my wife and me in 60s, played Pingpong game almost everyday, very good excercise, good for reflex, and  flexibility. To make playing Pingpong more fun, we bought 50 plus balls and played all balls out without picking up falling balls from the floor unless it is in your way.  The only regret we have is we did not buy Stiga earlier, we would have enjoyed earlier and longer for this high quality long lasting piece of equipment.
I bought this table as a daily deal and got a great price on it. Delivery was easy and the guys placed it where I asked. Unboxing was easy and putting the legs together was also very simple, but im also pretty handy with tools. I didnt time myself, but Id say from start to finish, I had the table set up in 30 minutes or less, including time to unpackage. The table is a breeze to fold up and sandwich the pieces together and wheel out of the way. Its easy to transition to a one player configuration as well. Setting up the full table is also easy, but takes a little alignment. The table is in my basement which has vinyl plank flooring over concrete slab, so its easy to move around. One complaint though is that it takes a while to get each side level and to line up exactly to the other side. The wheels will adjust up and down as well as the feet, so there are many adjustment points for each half of the table, but it still takes quite a while to adjust if the table is moved. Another negative I can see is that if you bump the table or hit it with any side force, the two halves can separate. It helps to lock the wheels down and Im sure if it were on carpet, it would t be as big of concern, but on vinyl flooring, it will scoot around if bumped. In my opinion, there needs to be a couple locks on the underside where the two halves meet, sort of like locking a leaf into an expanding dining room table. That would help with alignment and also stability. This is not a super heavy duty table, but it is plenty good enough for my family. The kids love it and it plays nice. If I remember, I paid right around $250 on sale, and it was well worth that price.
I set it up in about 20 minutes. Quality materials and design. It's so easy to move it fits in perfectly with our lifestyle. I paid a few bucks extra to have them deliver it to a specific room -- well worth it! Since we can't play pickleball outdoors with snow on the courts, this has been our Winter go-to!
Box arrived quite beat up but contents in perfect condition. Assembly was easy. A allen key came with table so you just need pliers or box / adjustable wrench. Maybe 10 minutes to assemble. Only mounting caster brackets. I am storing & playing in garage that requires folding up after each use to allow car parking. I think this table is perfect for that kind of use. I would suggest if you are purchasing a table that will never be folded up & stored you would do better to purchase a thicker tabletop model that is much heavier.  A heavier top would reduce bounce noise and be less likely to bend / warp. My table is not warped but only time will tell how it holds up to garage use with fluctuating temps & humidity. Paddles & balls not included so make sure you get some. Get alot of balls too cause they tend to go missing if you have small kids around.
This ping pong table comes 95% pre assembled. It took my daughter and I 15 minutes to set up and we were playing! I have set other tables up that have taken several hours. The quality of the table is also great and when you are done playing each half folds up and stores nicely. My 12 year old and 9 year old can get it out and put it away no problem. Each table half locks in an upright position and has high quality rubber wheels for easy transport and storage. It was even better that I got the table on amazon for $199 with white glove delivery service. You can't go wront with this table!
Looking back on my Ping Pong table purchase, I should have gotten an indoor/outdoor table instead of indoor only. That being said, I can easily fold up and wheel this table out to my garage, use it, then bring it back in when done. It really is that easy to move. Make sure you don't expose this table to humidity and or extreme temperature change.  It will warp the table and there are many warnings in the instructions to inform the buyer of this. Lastly, assembly is very easy bolt on the wheels and you're done. 8 bolts, washers, and nuts that's it.
This is our second Stiga table and even better than the first, which we loved. We have a circular staircase which would make it near impossible to access with most tables. This design comes mostly assembled but in two main pieces. Although stout, my wife and I were able to manage this task pretty easily. After a 10 minute assembly the kids were playing. I love the maneuverability and the net clamps which keep the table surface balanced. The feet also adjust to level the surface. Happy with what we paid and love the overall design of the Stiga Advantage.
Got 'STIGA Advantage' table tennis table during Amazon's 12-day daily deal specials, at a nice price point. This table is just sufficient for a family game room, garage etc. when people are not looking for the international tournament kind of table. The bounce is good enough and look-and-feel of the table is nice. My kid is learning table tennis from me and so far is liking this table. The packaging was nice with plyboard inside cardboard box around the wrapper of the two table pieces. The assembly is easy with two wrench of specific sizes, but two people are needed to flip the table over after fixing the roller castor legs. I will probably look for a nice cover for times when I keep the table folded on a side.
I tipped the delivery guys to carry this to my second story play room, it is a beast of a package to move.  Looks and plays well, very sturdy and should last virtually forever.  Arrived in perfect shape and was reasonably easy to put together, but these are heavy slabs of wood to maneuver, best to have a helper. I have not folded it so can't talk about that.
I ordered this table for my local VFW Post.  It was paid for by donations which I collected.  It was important to get a sturdy table that could also be used for occasional other purposes (meetings, etc.) and could be rolled away easily as well.  This fills the bill perfectly!  My boyfriend put it together in about 20 minutes.  He only needed help one time to turn each side of the table on the other side during assembly.  It plays VERY well, and is attractive as well, a nice slate blue.  I (a non-mechanical person) can fold this baby up in a few minutes so it can be stored against the wall.  In short, WE SCORED!!  Thanks, Stiga!!
Wow.  Got this two days ago.  It took like 30-minutes to put together.  All you need to do is screw the four wheel sets onto the table and you're done, the rest is already done for you. The quality of this table is that of any professional table I've seen and is quite impressive.  One caveat, is that when this gets delivered, the entire package is in excess of 250lbs and is big!  This is not a one, two, or three man job.  Four should do it.  So, make sure its get delivered at, or close to, where you will ultimately set it up.  If putting in a game room or basement like I did, I strongly suggest you unpack it where it is and then bring it downstairs in pieces, you know, to avoid death and all.  Its fricken HEAVY. Highly recommend this table to anyone at any level.
Everything I had hoped for.  Grandkids lover it too.
Very good quality, affordable price point, and very little assembly required. You only have to put the wheels on. One person can easily fold and unfold table. Each half folds separately. My only complaint is that the table halves are little bulky to move around. Please note balls and racquets are not included. Stiga makes a nice set of 6 balls and 4 raquets for $25. Overall this table is a must-have!
Very good quality. It comes pretty much pre assembled, except for the wheels. It took two persons about twenty minutes to attach the four sets of wheels. The table is heavy but looks very well finished. The two halves are not connected to each other and can be folded and stored separately. The table also comes with a net and clamps.
This is an excellent table tennis table. It was well packed and came in a sturdy package. The delivery was handled very profesionally. Assembly: It was very easy to complete the assembly. It took less than 30 mintutes to complete the setup. The instructions were very clear and easy to follow. Quality: Excellent quality. The table (both halves) built to last for long time. Portability: Easy to fold. It just takes 2-3 mintutes to fold and unfold. It can be competely folded for storage or can fold one side for practice. I really liked this feature. Overall, this is an excellent table tennis table for family fun.
A well-made table.  Balls bounce appropriately.  Almost professional-grade.  Highly recommend! The one thing I would recommend would be to pay for the additional delivery service to move the table into the room of your choice.  We had to move the heavy slabs that made up the tabletops ourselves into the basement from our garage and it was time consuming and laborious.  The assembly itself was otherwise easy.
The perfect indoor phydical activity for the teens during this Pandemic. Had it outdoors until the summer, super easy to fild and move.
We bought the "Advantage Pro" model, which has a thicker surface that the standard "Advantage" model, and we've been very happy with it.  The table looks nice and plays well.  It was easy to assemble and it seems sturdy.  It's been used for roughly 40 or 50 games thus far, and everyone who's played on it has liked it.  Have not yet tried folding it up or using it in tilt-up rebound mode for practice sessions.  Beware that the package is heavy--more than 200 lbs.  Its size and weight mean that two strong people are needed to move it.
It was easy to assemble. It is well made, sturdy and looks good! It folds up and stores easily. I especially like the net system, it has an easy way to install it and keep it tight. The table plays as well as a professional table. Highly recommend it!
This table is of high quality. Took one person 15 minutes to assemble the wheel legs, the only part needing assembly. Package was well protected. A good trade off with the 18mm tables that are heavy and difficult to assemble. Very satisfied.
I am so impressed with the sturdiness, ease of assembly and feature-rich table.  My wife can easily use one/both of the tables to display her jewelry or an overflow for food entertainment; with a cover on the table of course.  The ball response when using it for ping ping is incredible for just $400!!!  The design and strength is perfect for anyone wanting a casual table in their house/garage.  Many good times will be had with this over the years!
I am an occasional player and use this table for practice and exercise. The table was received in good condition, all preassembled and it took very short time to put together. It is heavy (which is good) and need to 2 man to carry and put together. Very high quality, looks good, suites our needs as far as ball bouncing and I could not tell the difference playing before on professional quality table.
Excellent product  - just as advertised.  Packed amazingly well and arrived as scheduled and in fine shape!  Although the package was large and heavy the shipping was professional and very little assembly required - my only disappointment is that it went on sale after I ordered it - $25 discount would have been nice but the table is worth the money.
We needed something else to do during the Stay at Home order, so we bought this table.  It was super easy to attach the wheels, everything else was already assembled.  Its level and is easy to store in our garage.  Fantastic ping pong table for the price!
Great Table! "STIGA Advantage". I ordered this product after reading multiple reviews.  I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.  I have only had the table for a week now, but I can tell already it will provide years of fun for me and my friends.  The table came well packaged, no defects, simple instructions and easy assembly. The table itself is as advertised; stable, solid, well constructed with a smooth blue surface and nice tight net.  Having the 2 separate playing surfaces each on their own wheel/caster sets is great for storage and singles practice playing.  I would absolutely recommend this table.
We purchased this table after loosing our old one to flood damage. Very happy with our purchase. We were able to assemble the table in about 45min. A lot of that time was spent looking for the wrench and the fact that there were 3 of us who all like to be in charge! Was very easy to assemble. The delivery guys were excellent and very easily maneuvered the large  box into the basement. Remembered a nightmare with delivery of our first table. Much better quality table than our first one. Feels very stable, good solid construction. We are fairly competitive players and have been very pleased with play on this table. Would highly recommend the Stiga Advantage!
This is a great table!!! It arrived within 2-3 days after I ordered it, the delivery guys brought it into my house for me and put it where I wanted it to go.  The table arrived in perfect condition, it comes in 2 pieces, the only assembly required is that you attach the four small legs, each with 2 casters, to the table.  The table halves are held together by the net clamp assembly which is as easy as squeezing the clamp handle and placing it where the two table halves meet.  Great for family fun, my kids love it.
Great table. well constructed and not very difficult to assemble, but it loses a star because it was advertised as free "expert assembly" but in fact had no assembly at all.  To add insult to injury, I had paid extra for expert assembly in a second floor room, but the delivery company (Pilot) insisted they only were obligated to unpack the table and remove the packing materials, not actually assemble the product.  So instead of coming home to an evening of recreational table tennis, I cam home to a project with some assembly required.
I really enjoy playing on this ping pong table. It looks great in our space, and it probably will in any. The table is very durable, too. It is pretty heavy, and my only complaints are the weight (before the wheels are installed, it's hard to move the pieces around) and that the instructions aren't so easy to follow. Took about an hour for two people to assemble. Overall, it's a great ping pong table! I will definitely be using it frequently!
We purchased this for the family for Christmas and it has been a blast. It came boxed up and was easy to set up. It appears very high quality and the fact that it's actually 2 tables on wheels is a great bonus. We have really enjoyed having competitions and look forward to many more!
I'm impressed with this table. The quality, the look, the feel, and durability is real good. I've used this table several times since quarantine . One of the best purchases I've made.
I received our new STIGA table yesterday.  I had always thought of having a ping pong table as I enjoyed one in my childhood.  When I opened the box, I was immediately impressed.  Great care was made in engineering the packaging.  Damage to the outside of the box had no affect on the product.  The table itself presents as a high quality, well engineered system.  It took me 15 minutes to install the caster wheels and the table was ready to go.  Love the easy folding and stacking design.  Plan to use it in our garage and the simple set up will make it a cinch to use.  Excited to start playing.
Table required very minimal construction and once it was unpacked it was being used in less than 30 minutes.  Well built table with functional ease to put away when not in use.  I would definitely recommend to others.  The materials are high quality and feel durable.
The table was easy to set up as all you have to do is attach the casters.  Folding and unfolding the table is very easy.  When it's folded, it takes up very little space.  The table itself looks great, solid and the bounce of the ball was fine. I had a neighbor over and he's looking to replace his old ping pong table.  He loved my table.  So much so that he said he was going to order one for the garage and one for the basement. The only problem I would say was the package arrived somewhat banged up.  I had a 2 small scratches on the outer white line on the table.
I bought the table based on many positive reviews and it didn't disappoint so far. The quality is good, assembly was very easy and it looks like a well made product. No one in my family plays professionally (or played in the juniors) but it seems like a great table to us that should last us many years. Delivery was somewhat slow but it's got nothing to do with the quality of the product.
Excellent quality - mounts very easily - everyone loves this table. Sort of meets expectations for such a high quality brand
Delivered on time--packaging was wonderful-absolutely no damage-quick to assemble-quality was excellent-exceeded expectation and very durable---------excellent value!
This table is the best investment in fun you will ever make.  This table needs very little, very quick additions.  Read about them and realize that the time involved is squat!  We play every night as a family and consider this time together as mental health time!  Have fun and connect as a family!  Your mileage may vary.
Easy set up in basement. 5/8 thickness, plenty of bounce for amateur players like me. Over two months in daily use. No problems
This table looks amazing. This is the first table I own but I can see it is super good quality and very easy to assemble. The blue finish on table looks very professional and I am very happy with the product thus far.  Assembly really took about 10 min,  just requires to insert and tighten 8 screws and you are all set. It  took me longer to unpack than to assemble the table. Keep in mind you need to get paddles and balls separately.
I bought this for the family playroom and for an amateur table this is a quality product. Be mindful of the weight when you order because it's heavy. The shipping box alone is probably 25-30 lbs. Assembly is easy and you might encounter a loose screw or two, which is no issue at all if you have a Phillips screw driver.
Easy to install, fold and unfold. Great table to play and store in garage!
The product arrived quickly and was well packaged, the boxes were banged up from shipping but the quality of the packaging protected the contents from damage.  The table took less than 10 minutes to assemble once it was unpackaged.  The quality of the table is exceptional, extremely stable and easy to move and lock into place when necessary.  The kids loved it and has given our family hours of play since we got it.
This is a solid table and very heavy.  It definitely needs at least 2 people to move and assemble.  Due to its heavy weight, it takes me more than 10 minutes to install although the process is simple with clear instruction.  After the assembly, the table looks great and quality is good.  It is definitely suitable for home entertainment.  The delivery process is not as smooth as I expected.  The truck driver postponed the morning delivery time and I ended up with waiting almost all day long and eventually received it in the late afternoon.
The price was right and the delivery was great.  We opened the box downstairs and moved it upstairs in the 2 pieces and was easy to assemble in our upstairs bonus room.  We should have made room for this table a few months ago.
I really liked the clamp set-up components for the net.  Seem strong and long lasting.  I also like the way the table sets up for single player practice.  My only complaint is the way the legs are fastened underneath to the table.  They are very weak and will easily tear away.  During set up, one leg tore away from the table bottom, where just two tiny screws were holding it together.  I will need to reinforce the legs as they each break down with usage.
I bought the table on 03/14/17, received on 03/17/17, sharp schedule, perfect! Very nice table, my whole family are ping pong amateurs for sure. The only problem was with the Net, one side arrived damaged. It looks very solid, but maybe it was a factory defect. Just contacted EscaladeSports to claim the warranty, I will post updates as soon as I receive back from them. Despite the problem with the net It looks great and is really solid and heavy. Delivery was great and the guy brought it to my entrance room as only my wife was home when they came. I put the table together by myself in about 10 mins.
We loved this table from the get-go! Delivery shocked us it came so early in the morning, but its a huge box. Husband muscled it down to basement. Easy to set up, we were playing in no time. Sturdy enough. Moveable and foldable. Weve used to maybe 40 times since purchase and its really a nice addition to our home.
This table was everything that I had hoped for. It was super easy to assemble and was very quick altogether. The table is big enough to have a fun, playable game but small enough to be able to store away with ease. There were no scratches or even smudges when we got it and it was super clean. It looks like a good size that fits in our basement and doesnt look out of place. Overall, this was an amazing table and I highly recommend a purchase!
In my option, any table tennis players that ranked 1800 or below should be satisfied with this table. Playability: if you are playing at home with this table tennis table and you immediately feel that this table provide a very nice bounce. Quality: It comes with a professional net. It probably the best ping pong table you could find that under $400. Aesthetics: Stylish looking and lightweight enough for one person to roll around in two pieces. Assembly: The table tennis table is 95% pre-assembled in the box,  it takes about 10 minutes for assembling entire table set.
The table is great for any skill level be it just for casual play or even professional players.  The table has a very smooth surface and the net is high quality.  When serving the ball by spin or even regularly the ball just tend to bounce up a little higher than usual but is expected when the table is brand new.  I like the feature the ability to store the table in a remote place with small dimensions. Out of the box it is very easy to assemble and can be done within 20 minutes.  I enjoy the various features in this table that making the playing experience more enjoyable
I received this product and upon opening found all the four hinges bent along with the support bracket underside of the table. The built quality is extremely poor and not worth the money. Assembly, cut and finish is substandard and not worth a penny. I sincerely do not recommend this poor Chinese built cheap product. It is a shame that such products are passing the QC and flooding the market.
I decided not to buy the most expensive version of this table because I am not a great ping-pong player but my family loves it. When it arrived I was very impressed with the packaging right off. The box had been abused a little bit as (is often the case with delivery) but THIS box was reinforced with wood so no worries! The table was really easy to assemble and it could not be easier to move around and out of the way when we want to use the space for other things. VERY happy with my purchase and highly recommended!
It's working beautifully so far. - Recommend getting the in-house delivery and paying to have it put into its ultimate home if the table needs to traverse stairs.  It's pretty heavy in the box.  But once the box is opened, it's fairly simple to assemble with straightforward instructions.  Make sure you have 2 people to lift and flip the 2 sides of the table. - Looks great, excellent playability, and feels like a high-quality table.  Unless you're training for something, this seems to be a perfect choice table, no need to spend more on a fancier version.  We needed something solid, durable, and that looked good for family ping pong night and for my kids' friends to enjoy when they came over. - So far, I highly recommend the Stiga.
Still day 2 of owning this product, but love how easy it is ti assemble (10 mins tops), how easy it is to fold and move. It is smooth, and has a great bounce (very important). Came nicely packaged. Was apprehensive prior to purchase but this did not let me down.
While doing the assembly, we noticed that the levers that lock the legs were put on upside down.  Actually, It took us a while to figure it out, and could have easily damaged it because at first, we were trying to force it up to lock.  The lever should be bent down slightly, and easily pushed up to lock, like the diagram says.  Just wanted to point that out to raise awareness in case there are others out there.  I wanted to leave a feedback to the Seller but that option was not available.  But, once assembled
My Stiga Advantage Table Tennis Table came on time , well packaged and product looks sturdy.  Fairly easy assembly i you have relevant tools.  Unfortunately , hit an issue while assembling when I saw 2 missing hex nuts and bolts. Worked with Escalade Sports and they shipped in couple of days.  I really wish it came with a cover considering the price and there are stricter checks on missing parts to avoid un-necessary inconvenience. Never mind , so far so good stuff happens , may be I was out of luck this time.  Enjoying my table.
Had been planning to put one in our for a while, excellent price on Amazon, it was easy to set it up out of box with my daughter, played 3 sets with family and we are just getting started. Very happy with the excellent quality of the table, the bounce is perfect, looks competition grade and hope it will last me a while. Keeping each half upright for practice is truly a snap. I highly would recommend Stiga and this particular table.
We recently bought the STIGA Advantage Lite table tennis table. As advertised, it was extremely easy to assemble - all you had to do was attach the 4 casters onto the table legs, which took about 15 minutes total. There is no other assembly required. When we flipped the table over, 2 screws fell out of the metal bar attached under the table. The screws had come loose from the hole drilled into the table and we had to open up a new hole for those screws, but the screws still didn't feel solidly engaged. The table top is shallow (0.5"), so there's not much wood for the screws to engage into. Other than that, the table is working fine and we're already having hours of fun playing table tennis. It's also very easy to fold and stow.
The table came well packaged, the packing has plastic corner protectors and a solid mdf board on each side to protect the cardboard from punctures. The table assembles easily in 20 min with a ratchet and a fixed wrench. The net is high quality and the brackets are excellent. Really good value for money, it also folds vertical in two separate parts. STIGA Advantage Indoor Table Tennis Table
The first thing that stood out to me about this table was how easy it was to assemble.  I saw other similar quality tables where it said be prepared to take about 2 hours to assemble it.  This literally took me and my son about 15 minutes, tops.  All we had to do was place 8 bolts into the legs and we were ready to play. The table itself is perfect.  It folds easily and stores in a very small place considering the size of a ping-pong table.  We found it to be very playable.  I have played A LOT of ping-pong over the years and this table is fantastic.  Good playing surface and the table looks great as well.  I like that there are safety hinges in place to make sure that when the table is folded up it can not fall back down. Overall, great table!!
My floor is pretty level. The issue I have is that the table is slightly tilted on both ends towards the net. The rubber feet at the ends are threaded, but they are already threaded all the way in, so I cannot drop the ends to make the table fully level. It's possible my flooring has a slight dip in the middle, buy it's a bad design miss to only give you level adjustment in one direction. Otherwise, the table is excellent and highly recommended.
This is a fantastic value and product.  My wife and I have looked for a while for a really good ping pong table under $600.  This is absolutely the right one.  The materials used are first class, solid, and put together really nice.  Set up was a breeze too.  I would recommend not paying for the put together service.  We had ours put together in about 30 minutes or less.  Its basically some bolts to attach the leg with the wheels to the table.  If you have a ratchet set it can be done easily.  We were able to play right away and our son loved it.  Hes seven and was enjoying it from the moment we had it down.  By comparison to box box stores or discount clubs versions of this (even in same brand) this is a better table.  Compared to home leisure store versions its the same / similar quality but $100-$200 less.
This table is awesome for the price, well worth the 100$ Difference over cheaper tables. We had it delivered to the porch. We planned on putting it together ourselves so did not opt to pay for the extra amazon assembly. We opened it on the porch and carried the two separate table top pieces, one at a time, to our basement. The table comes in 2 pieces, plus two accessory boxes (one is the wheel castles and hardware, the other is the net). The individual pieces were a little heavy (this tells me it is solid-good quality) even for my wife and I...if you are older or by yourself, you will not be able to move this thing. Assembly was insanely simple. You just need two wrenches to counter tighten the bolts. The only assembly required is attaching the wheel castors-then flipping the table right side up...I did not need help for the flipping when I was done assembling. The table is actually two separate pieces, and never shall the two meet. You push them together and clamp the net on. When you want to move it? Unclamp the net, slide the pieces apart, and fold. They move separately on wheels. Do the same if you want to practice against yourself-fold one side, and push it against the table. I love it, and it has been PERFECT for the family while we try to flatten the curve during our mandated COVID-19 shelter in place. I have zero regrets about purchasing this table.
My only complaint with this table would be the fact that it is awkward to get into the house (especially since ours was going into the basement), however, my husband and I opened the box outside and brought 1/2 the table in at a time and, although still heavy and awkward to carry, we were able to do it just the 2 of us. Otherwise- this table is way nicer than my husband and I even expected it to be and we love it! He said that it was very easy to assemble and he did it all himself. It is also very easy to move around since there are wheels for easy moving. I would highly recommend this ping pong table if you are looking for a nice table and do not want to spend a crazy amount of money.
ok so here is my first take and review on this product. ill probably write an update after a few months once i've used this for a while. the table itself is sturdy and heavy. the quality of the product looks great for a "beginner" table. worth the money i would say. it took me roughly 30 min to put together, with a help from a friend. ( FYI you need another adult to lift the table and stand it up cause its heavy). the screws and directions are pretty straightforward and quick to put together. once its set its awesome. the bounce on the table was true and was awesome to play with. i even ordered some extra bats so that i can start doing a ping-pong night every week. overall i would say i love the looks the price and ease of the assembly of the product. Well worth the money.
Pleasantly surprised to receive the table today six days after ordering.  It came couple of days before promised date. The table came with all parts included, no scratches, no nicks and nicely wrapped. The table was mostly pre-assembled so I took us less than 20min to installed the set of polyurethane wheels and moved the table into place.  The set up was sturdy and the wheels are large enough that each half of the table can easily be moved.  The whole leg assembly looks solid and table is very well leveled. The table surface is flat and free of blemishes.  The bounce was uniform using Nittaku *** Premium 40+.  The traction is decent and no slippage.  The table seems solid and produces nice bouncing sound given that it is 3/4" thick.  I am sure other more expensive tables must be very nice if not nicer than this one but for less than $600 this table serves its purpose well and meets my needs.
Installation: The main reason I bought this is because I didnt want to spend hours putting a table together. It took a few minutes to unpack and we were playing in no time. The installation was also particularly easy, Amazon delivered it right inside my garage and then it took me 30 minutes to understand the instructions and 20 minutes to set it up. Cost:  Cost of the table is best compared to other tables with this price range. I would say this one has a much better bounce than others in this range. It is easy to fold and takes around 3-4 feet of space when folded. Easy to setup again to play, takes 2-3 minutes to setup the net and match the 2 halves. Quality:  The table is very high quality. The hardware is well engineered and strong - the legs fold out smoothly and lock into place easily. The playing surface is a nice blue color and is solid. It is easy to set up and level for play. I was afraid the 2 piece construction would make the table feel unstable, but it is as solid as other one piece tables I have used - it doesn't come apart at all - even when the kids are leaning on it! You just have to push the two sections of the table together and connect it using the provided net. The net clamps on to the table top and keeps the sections together. Playability:  The playability is better than anything Ive played on in the past, incredible ball response and controlability. The net string slip knot needed to be adjusted to get a better tension on the net, but it worked out great. Overall, it has been a great purchase!
I'm a recreational, but decent player, and wanted my kids to learn how to play, so I had my wife watch for these tables to go on sale during the Christmas season, and it did, so we grabbed an Advantage pro.  I'm super happy with the price and the quality.  Shipping took a while, a couple of weeks or more, but in all fairness, they said what the exact receive date would be, and they were spot on.  The shipper called to confirm delivery the day before.  So that all went well.  The shipped package was heavy, I think they said 300 lbs.  We were going to put the table upstairs, so we just opened the box and took each half of the table up one at a time.  Assembly was super easy.  It was all assembled except for the wheels on each table half, otherwise completely ready to go.  I'm pretty particular, so I took a phillips screwdriver and just checked every single screw on the bottom of the table, and only found a few that weren't completely tight, but they were not hanging loose either, just not all the way tight.  I was surprised to find that not a single screw was stipped into the wood, as I figured at least a few would be, but they weren't.  The only thing that I found that was not tight all around, was the wheels, where they screw into the metal tubing. Not a big deal, but check these to you don't get any lean or sag of your wheels.  Th net clamps and net setup are awesome; super easy to put on and off, with adjustable height too.  The table folds and stores very easy (each half is independent if you didn't know).  I am super happy with this setup and would highly recommend, especially if you find it on a flash sale on Amazon.  The only thing I would recommend to the manufacturer, is to have the ability to adjust for level on the wheel side/s or each table half, and not just the rubber foot (ends of each half), as most floors aren't perfectly level, and it is hard to level each half when all you have are adjustable feet both on the same side of the table half.  Otherwise, great setup.
We received the ping-pong table in a crate that weighed 200 pounds gross. And because the crate had some dings, tears, and dents from its journey with UPS, we were very pleased to discover that the table itself was in pristine condition once we got it out of the shipping container. So, that the first point: the quality and care associated with the shipping process by the vendor are apparent. The shipping crate was a fortress of protection and this best ensures that the journey is only one-way. The setup for the table is very easy. I think it took me less than thirty minutes after unpacking the table from the shipping container to get it fully assembles and up on its wheels. I only used a nut-driver and box-end wrench ... I think around 9/16ths. You will need two people, as they advise, to easily turn the table over onto its legs. Once on its wheeled legs, the two-part table will fold and stow away very compactly up against a wall with ease. Getting it back into position for play is just as easy. Both of these processes can be accomplished by a single person. The engineering is well thought out for ergonomics. No heavy lifting at all. Once we got the table set up, my wife and I played a game to try out the stability of the platform. The table was rock solid. The official table markings are a silk screen that should endure for years of play. The clamp-on net is very easy to install and take down. We are both very pleased with this purchase. We have always loved racquet sports--tennis, racquetball, and pickleball--and having this ping-pong table now promises to bring an indoor joy of more racquet play.
Just received table about 3 hours ago.  Delivery was excellent: Though the outside of on one side of box had a gash the inside was perfect!  The hardest part has been breaking down the reinforced box to put in the recycling bin.  The delivery guys said they had delivered Table Tennis tables before but this was the heaviest one yet.  I put the legs on quickly and it was done.  Checked for level and started playing.  I shopped around big box stores, sports stores, read reviews, lots of reviews, and could not be happier with choice.
We are certainly not good players... but this table is awesome and was extremely affordable considering the quality. We love it, and have no complaints. It is a good solid unit and everything down to the paint and finish and the netting clamps is well made.
We bought this table for our teenage son and the herd of friends that hang out at our house. STIGA Advantage Table Tennis Table The table goes from 2 player mode to single player mode very easily, there is one latch and you lift up. The net secures the two halves of the table together and I am fairly certain it took longer to break down and haul away the box than it did to complete the set up. That being said, it arrived very securely packaged, not that it was difficult to unpack, but it was definitely quality packing material and the table was in perfect condition when it was opened. It's a very nice shade of blue, it looks great in the room and it has already weathered many hours of playing time in the 2 weeks it's been here.
This is an outstanding table -- and a great value! The product was packaged well and assembled easily. Probably took us less than 20 minutes. I love the two independent halves, which give flexibility for storage, one-person playback, and even independent tables for table games or extra guests (covered with table cloths of course). The stationary legs adjust to easily level the table halves, and the surface plays really well -- nice solid feel and even bounce. The net cord tension adjusts easily, and the independent elevation screws on each side of the net allow it to be adjusted and leveled at the right height. Overall, it's a quality table that I'm sure we will enjoy for a long time.
The box was incredibly heavy, but Amazon delivery moved it into my house perfectly. The table was easy to put together. About 15-20 minutes once completely out of the box. It is a great table. Sturdy, good thickness and bounce, easy to fold into single-player position. We love it and and playing a lot.
Affordable yet high qualify. Very satisfied. Folds and moves easily hence perfect for our garage where we use for other activities too.
Decided to purchase a ping pong table.  Checked out the reviews and was not disappointed.  Easy to assemble.  Easy to store.  Gets plenty of use.
The installation is very easy. It took 2 people around 30 minutes to install it. Once you install it, you are ready to go. After installation, the folding and unfolding can be easily done by one person with minimum effort and it doesnt take a lot of space in the garage. Our package arrives with nice condition, no scratch, missing parts etc.
Very good quality,  professional looking and playing experience. Most importantly, extremely easy to assemble.  Got it up and running in less than 30 minutes.  The video instructions on unpacking and assembly come handy, though you will not need it. Great qualify and affordable ping pong table.  Great value for the price.
It took the delivery boys some muscle power to take this item to my basement. But once opened the box assembly was done in about 20 mins. Very easy. Aesthetically very pleasing. Sturdy construction. If you are a pro then probably you want to go for a higher config with thicker board. I am using this for practicing with my 8 year old son. So far so good.
Playability- Good Bounce. Quality - Great. Back side of table arrived with minor scratches. Doesn't impact playability Aesthetics - Great. Assembly - Easy to assemble, you just need to attach wheels..... Shipping - My shipment didn't arrive in time... Got wrong updates from Amazon. Non stop delivery and Amazon trackings were different. Its been 2 days and me and my family enjoying playing TT every day. Looking to buy a cover as we live in MN and thinking how to keep it safe during winters.
This table is robust enough for home use, and the action is lively.  The castors are actually pretty good:  they swivel and roll well, the locking mechanism is simple and solid, and the texture is grippy but non-marking.  This table is a treat to move and store. Finish is uneven, what one would expect for a mass-manufactured product from China, but certainly not bad. I am delighted with this table, and would recommend it for the price ($400).
This table was highly recommended to me by a friend.  I was a little skeptical of his glowing review but now that I have mine, I agree 100%.  The table was packed so well and it arrived with no damage at all.  It was a snap to assemble; it took my wife and me less than 15 minutes to put everything together from start to finish.  The quality met and even exceeded my expectations.  There is not one criticism that I can offer and as icing on the cake, the price was very reasonable.  I, too,  highly recommend this product.
Super easy to assemble and excellent play.  Exceptional quality.  I was considering spending the extra $100 for the 'Pro' model, but I'm glad I didn't - this one is just perfect for basic at home play.  Highly recommend paying the extra $20 for delivery to the location inside your home (which I did).  That box is incredibly heavy and difficult to move - especially if you have to negotiate stairs.
When the package arrived I was so excited but I couldnt move the box. So I got a few people to help me slide it up the stairs. It was heavy and took a while but dont let this discourage you. You do have to take the two halves out of the box and put on legs, wheels, and net. But the results are worth it! It has such a nice finish and it is such a cool table that you can fold and move for space. This table is very professional.
I was worried that the table would arrive dented or beat up.  was I wrong.  The packaging is incredible.  The table was in flawless condition.  It assembled very easily in very short order.  The net and it's clamps were impressive.  The wheels are large enough to move it effortlessly across deep pile carpet.  The playing surface was flawless.  The table is very sturdy.  This one will be in the family for a long time. (And it really doesn't hurt my feeling that my wife beat me 4 games to 2 in our first outing!)  This table is a great value.
Excellent product at a reasonable price from a top company, and simple to assemble.  All hardware that needed to be attached to the table top halves has already been attached.  You need two wrenches (socket, crescent, or adjustable crescent wrenches) or, if used carefully, pliers could substitute for one wrench in holding a bolt head while tightening a nut.  To assemble, slip a washer on a bolt, thread the bolt through one bracket, one table leg, and another bracket.  Slip on a washer, put a nut on the end of the bolt, and tighten the nut.  Each nut has an insert of nylon, Teflon, or polypropylene, making it necessary to use two wrenches, but also making it unlikely anything will ever need to be tightened again.  There are eight bolts to be applied, and that is the whole assembly operation.  It took us about 30 minutes to do, slowly and carefully.  Screw the adjustable feet all the way into the table legs initially, and unscrew them as needed to adjust the table top to be straight and level. This is an indoor table; do not let it get rained on. WARNING: DO NOT store these table halves in a locked and upright position where a small child could get access to them!  A child could unlock the latch and be seriously injured by the table top coming down onto the child's head. To lower a table half into playing position, hold the top of the table half, which is about six feet off the floor, with one hand, unlock the latch with the other hand, and lower the table top into horizontal position.  If the table top does not begin to come down easily, pull the upper legs out from the table top a little, and the table top should then come down with no problem. The modern rules of table tennis:  Games are now to 11 points, not 21.  Each player now gets 2 serves at a time, not 5.  If the score becomes 10-10, that is deuce, and each player now gets one serve until a player wins the game by leading by two points, similar to what it was previously when deuce was 20-20.  May you have many happy returns!
The STIGA Advantage table is a well-designed, quality ping-pong table, well worth the money. To start with, the net clamps make setting up the net so much easier it's almost ridiculous. Also, the foldable feature allows for quick and easy dis-assembly and storage. The adjustable table legs let you adjust the height of the table quite easily, and then the net clamps finish leveling the table. As to quality and durability, the table is made out of quality materials and seems to hold up to use very well.
We ordered the table tennis table during Thanksgiving of 2019, but we received the table about a month later. It was not delivered on the day it was scheduled for. On calling Amazon, we had the delivery re-scheduled for a week later as the table could not be tracked (not sure why). Again the table was not delivered. This time we were told that the table was "lost". Considering that the table tennis table is fairly large in size and quit bulky, not sure how it could be lost. By this time, I was losing my patience with it and had the order canceled and re-ordered the table. Finally, after about 3-4 weeks, we got the table. However, the table itself is really good and very easy to assemble. It took me a total of about 15 minutes to assemble it, but needed about two people to get it upright. Since then my son has had a fun time playing on it.
So, in short, I love the table. I love ping pong so It couldve been a piece of plywood and Id still play it. Im not a seasoned player however Id love to put more time into it. So I got this. It is a nice table for the price. The family likes it. It folds easily. I dropped a star because one of the wheels is stuck locked. Even if I release the lock it is still stuck. Im hoping to contact the seller for a replacement. Other than that, great table.
The table was very easy to assemble, easy to set up, and easy to stow away.  It's fairly durable, but not made of super heavy duty materials.  The legs have wheels, which help, and overall it's pretty easy to play with.  I've played on some better tables, but for the price I certainly can't complain. The only issue I would note is that the table came in a box that was heavily damaged, and the packaging was missing a plastic corner brace on one of the corners.  That particular corner was smashed (on both sides of the table).  The company did replace it without question (although it took another week).  It was unfortunate, since the entire table probably had to be trashed because they didn't reinforce one corner during the shipping (and the shipping company didn't handle it with a great deal of care).
This is a great beginner table. Inexpensive and plays really well. Be careful of the corners though they are very sharp and especially with kids somebody could get hurt. Four stars because the table was assembled wrong from the factory assembly so I had to unassembled part of it and then reassemble it the right way to make it work. Also do not over tighten the bolts as I stripped one without using very much for some but was able to there are a couple extra washers on to tighten up on other threads. Overall very happy with the table so far.
In these strange quarantine times, I was looking for something to keep the kids busy and at least a little bit active.  I can understand why this table is rated so highly.  The quality is excellent, the assembly easy and the delivery was perfect.  We are very happy with our purchase and look forward to many hours of family fun.
Product arrived on time and in good shape.  Shippers were professionals and the package and product were undamaged.  Assembly was easy, but I agree that TWO adults are needed to flip the tables over at the end.  I like the two piece construction, table is stable and level.  No problems with it separating due to net being the only pieces holding it together.  Table is beautiful and high quality and the net is easy to use and perfect.  Love the oversized easy rolling wheels with locking mechanism.  I give this table 5 of 5 and would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice casual table at a good price.
While the table is definitely a great product and value for money , one thing that hurt me here is the fact that Amazon or Stiga did not tell me that it is very easy to assemble that no assembly services were required like the Instaplay table which is a bit more expensive than this one. As a result I lost $125  for assembly service which only took 5-10 mins to be done very minimal effort required. Though the service provider was very good and got it done in 15 mins tops after coming in , I had to pay a hefty sum to amazon to get it assembled. Could have been better advised . So happy with the table but not happy about loosing money on assembly which was not required unlike other complicated tables where you do .
It took less than an hour to complete the installation. It took some time to find the right tool because I do not have enough number of tools, otherwise, it would have taken even less time. Some of my friends told me that it took almost a day to install their table that they bought from a local store which is a different brand. So, I was looking for a particular table which will take very less time in installation and hassle-free. Luckily I found this. I will definitely recommend this for the people who want to start playing within few minutes from arriving. Quality is excellent. I played almost 50 times so far on this table, quality was excellent and I like the blue color too. Appearance wise, it looks so attractive, you will be proud to show it to your friends. Many of my friends told me that this table looks good much better than their tables.
in putting this together, one of the braces was upside down and turned the wrong way. One of the poles  had a hole drilled in it on the wrong side. I had to call a handy man to re- do the bracket with tools we did not have and use a metal drill and soder to drill a hole placed correctly. Its very sturdy but quality issues like that are super aggravating ! I can not imagine putting this together without a professional handyman.Again- very sturdy, sturdier than a normal table.
My Stiga Advantage Pro was delivered to our home precisely as promised and loaded directly onto my trailer where I then took it to our lake home.  The table was packaged and protected very well with not a scratch on it.  While I did back very close to our basement, I was able to unbox and set the table up with no help.  The two table halves are pretty heavy but I had no problem carrying them in for the setup.  Im super pleased with the quality, strength, and workmanship of this table!  After much research, this unit was in my opinion, the very best bang for the buck and I couldnt be happier with the purchase!
We bought this on prime day for my 14-year-old son.  We did have a couple of issues with putting it together but Amazon was very accommodating.  It is used in our basement almost daily.  Good quality for the price.
I was thinking of getting a cheaper table - so happy I paid a little more to get this table. really looks good and is a nice table. super easy to assemble as others have written. It's 8 bolts to connect the 4 roller legs. small package so it went into my basement without any problems. easy to fold up and move around.  really happy with this table.
We've had a blast the past week playing ping-pong on this great table. Assembly is simple, but you will need your own two box or ratchet wrenches to tighten the nuts on eight total bolts. The two halves of the table are largely preassembled and it will take two moderately strong people to move them where you want for setup. Assembled, the table is absolutely flat and straight and solid. It has a high quality, aesthetic  finish. We haven't tried using it in the practice configuration, but it  should be quite easy, based on the initial setup. The net is a snap to put in place. Very well designed. One possible area for improvement in design would be to include height adjustable, lockable casters on the outside legs. If you want to move the table, as it is currently, it is really best to unclamp the two halves before doing so. It would be convenient if it were easier to move the whole table without unclamping the two halves, and casters on the outside legs would allow this. But overall, a great purchase. Highly recommended!
My wife and I are competitive table tennis players, and we tremendously enjoy playing every day on this very well-manufactured table tennis table.  It's a sturdy good looking indoors table, and the blue color is so much more pleasing to the eye than green (best played with orange-color table tennis balls).  We got the table delivered right to our door (despite various step that lead up to our house; most deliveries are left in front of the garage, but not this one, yay!).  As other buyers already noted, assembly is easy as pie.  It took us just about 15 minutes until everything was assembled (which was quite easy for 2 people).  Most is pre-assembled.  We would like to give this table two enthusiastic thumbs up.
After an hour's research, I chose this and am not disappointed. Table plays very true and consistently. Assembly was fairly easy. Packaging was excellent. Take the extra time to go around with a Phillips screwdriver and check screw torque before you flip it over upright.I found a third of the screws on the edge band were tight, a third were loose and a third were stripped, as thought it was not manufactured with torque-to-yield equipment. No missing hardware!
After much research, our family decided to buy this ping pong table and have been very satisfied. Based on reviews and articles, we wanted a good table for frequent playing with family and friends. The Stiga Advantage has been the perfect solution. It sets up very easily, looks great in the room, and easily folds up and wheels away to be stored and make room for other activities in the room. My 9 year old daughter quickly learned the operation and moves it with ease - which is saying a lot considering the weight of the table itself. When set up for playing, it is solid and stands up to pretty rough play. My 12 year old son and I play nearly every night and we recently held a tournament with ten teenagers. Other than a few hand smudges, the table endured paddles hitting it, kids jumping across the table, etc without leaving a mark. All in all, this table plays really well, is clearly well-made and sturdy, looks good, and is easy to store. Would highly recommend.
This is absolutely perfect for my family. I particularly love how it can fold up so compact should we ever want to put it away in the garage for a time. We thought about spending more money on something "nicer," but I am so glad we didn't. This is a great table!  There was also minimal assembly. And even my 8-year-old can change it to single play. Very simple!
Our STIGA table shipped from across the country and even changed freight lines.  The box arrived badly damaged with a crushed corner, partial hole punched into side, and even forklift marks rammed into the edge.  We thought "no way this is not damaged!"  Instead, it was in perfect condition - packed with 1/8" masonite laminated cardboard and 1/2" edge protection all edges.  We expecially love the table - high quality and worth the $100 above the std STIGA (which we also own).
About the product: The table looks very steady with great support structure and great quality table top. The top color is not very dark and it plays very well. I use to play at my friend's house where he had a convertible table tennis top on a pool table - so when I got this table - it felt a little low. I measured the height and other dimensions and it matched up perfectly with the standards including the net height. Assembly was very easy. Just a bunch of screws to attach the wheels and that is it. Ready to play in 15 minutes. The clamps for the net is what holds the two halves together. A dedicated clamp for keeping the two halves together would be better but the net clamps work great too. The table stows away very nicely when not in play. I love the slight red color in the frame. It gives this table a distinct look. Amazon delivery: When i first got the table - the box looked a little rough and when I opened the table - it was broken from one of the corner. I called Amazon back and they immediately scheduled a replacement. The new table was in my house within a week. The delivery people took the other table out from my basement and delivered this one down. Can't complain about this great service.
I bought this for my 13 year old son and I to be able to keep a little active during the pandemic. I was tentative in buying it because I was concerned about the weight, getting it into the basement and putting it together. Im a 52 year old Mom with a bad neck and my son is only 13. The first obstacle was getting it into the basement and luckily when the delivery men brought it, they accepted my offer of an additional $20 cash to bring it down. There is no way we could have done that. I was pleasantly surprised that it was quite easy to put it together. It didnt take long at all for my 13-year-old son and I to put this together and start playing ping-pong right away. I am so thankful I made the choice to buy this and highly recommend to anyone considering it! It has become our evening entertainment.
This is a big upgrade from the flimsy miniature table I had before!  Table is sturdy, folds up and rolls around easy.  Assembly wasn't too bad, you just need to attach four legs.  You will need two wrenches to assemble it though.  The two halves were light enough that I could flip them over by myself, though you will definitely need help if you want to lift the table up.  I haven't played on the table enough yet to get a feel for it, but I can tell it's much better than my old cheap table.  This is also the best price for the thickness of the table I could find!
We LOVE this ping pong table!  The delivery was awesome, they even carried it down to my basement for me.  My husband was able to assemble this quickly and easily.  The directions were great.  This is a high quality table, even better than I expected.  It looks great, I love the blue color.  We have already had so much fun playing together on this table and look forward to lots more fun.  This was a great purchase, I am so happy with my choice and would definitely recommend this table to anyone!
This is an excellent ping pong table in this price range!!!  I used to compete at region level(15yrs ago), but haven't been able to keep up with the game since work demands, young kids and a small house.  On and Off, I was able to train my kids with the basic foundation at a friend's office (butterfly tournament grade table).  Recently we moved to a new place, kids have been wanting to play more without bother friend on the weekend.  After some research, we decided to buy this Stiga table for our family. The new table arrived in perfect shape in a delivery truck on Saturday morning.  My son and I put them together in less than 15 minutes.  The bounce is excellent and is comparable to the office butterfly table (lot more expensive). We had so much fun and couldn't stop playing.  The next day, we invited friends over, we now got competition :-) Love this table, and love the family/friend time hanging around this table.  We will definitely be using it as our daily "gym", and will prepare us for next cruise ship ping pong tournament :-)
We received this table in perfect condition.  It as very well packed and came exactly when stated by Amazon.  My husband and I are in our seventies and we found the table easy to assemble.  It is also. Wry easy to put away.  I can do it by myself, just fold it up and roll it to the side of the room!  I could not do that with the table we were replacing.  The net is very easy to clip on and is sturdy.  Our children, grandchildren and friends have all complimented the new tablewe love itthe perfect table for lots of use at our vacation home.
Table arrived on time.  Since the item is so  large, I was able to select the day and 3-hour window of time for delivery.  Delivery calls in advance to remind us of delivery, and they called 25 minutes before they arrived, too.  Table comes in 2 pieces.  Each piece is heavy.  My husband and I were able to carry to our basement.  Easy assembly.  I wiped table down (bottom and top).  Few minor cuts/scratches on the underside of table, but being it is wood, this is to be expected.  Now everyone will enjoy many hours of fun playing ping pong and maybe even get really good like Forrest Gump!  Watch for the best sale as we purchased for $200 OFF price.
Very high quality overall. Folding / unfolding is very easy: you can fold, wheel away and secure the table in about a minute. Same thing for unfolding. The playing surface is made of a great material that produces a very lively ball bounce. The net the table comes with is exceptionally well designed and requires zero tinkering/leveling. It can be attached to the table in 15 seconds.
So disappointed, I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my kids and when we took it out to set it up, there was a crack all the way down the table. Because I ordered it early it cant be returned so I guess now we will use it until the crack goes through the table and then throw it away.
Shipping good, received on time. Packed well but you definitely need 2 strong people to move the box. Assembly was pretty easy but one of the bolts was damaged so had to call for another one. We were a little disappointed that the bolt couldnt be shipped until Monday, called Friday. Anyway made due with another bolt from our garage, the assembly took about 30 minutes, not 10. However, the important thing is how the table plays which I thing is really great. So all in all we are very happy, assuming we get the bolt Tuesday.
I wouldnt say 10 minutes from box to playing but it is fairly simple to assemble. Youll need both 13mm and 14mm sockets/wrenches and the rest will flow pretty easily. One bolt stripped out so will be contacting manufacturer and expect no issues getting replacement piece. Was surprised there were no extra parts for just in case situations as mine but I get it. Big hit with all 5 kids 11,13,13,15 year olds and even the 18 month old toddler! Great value at pre-holiday $299 price point. No regrets.
First table received was damaged (all corners) and had exchanged for a new one. Second table received was damaged as well. I had to fix table legs supports. Otherwise table is nice.
We love this table and would've given it 5 stars except the first one delivered was damaged.  The 2nd one was here  a day later and was perfect.  The delivery team stayed while we confirmed no damage on the second one which was nice.  Setup was super easy, I mean really fast and easy.  Would totally recommend this table again and again.
Finally got to putting this table together. What a snap. I was figuring on hours of assembly. Only took a few minutes basically. What a great table. Very robust and well built. Was worth the extra few dollars for something this solid.
This is our second table. Our first table was an intro level $100 Big 5 on sale purchase. We wanted to see if the family would take to the game before investing in a more expensive table.  This table is the perfect upgrade! Delivery came quicker than planned, which was a nice surprise.  Assembly was easy and fast. The quality of the table looks and acts great. The rods and wheels feel durable and high quality.  On top, the ball play and reaction is better than expected. It's an attractive looking table tennis table.  The color is sharp and vibrate. Folding the table up is super easy.  I am extremely happy with how little room the table takes up while folded.  We really like this table!
I spent a ton of time doing research on ping-pong tables, and this seemed like the best deal based on a number of factors. So far, it has not disappointed at all. It was reasonably easy to assemble, it looks great, and plays well. We have it in a garage and can't yet confirm how it will hold up during winter, but it has survived summer in upstate NY (not extreme temps but pretty warm and humid/rainy) in a not-entirely-indoors environment. With such a good price, I won't be terribly devastated if it needs to be replaced in the not-too-distant future -- though I expect it to last for years to come. Very satisfied overall.
We moved into a modern new office and had room for a ping pong table in our "Bistro".  After reading reviews for the Stiga Advantage indoor table, I chose it. 'The price was very good too.  The table was delivered right up to the 17t floor, in perfect condition and it took a couple of my colleagues about 15 minutes to assemble it.  It does take two or more people  to assemble because it comes in two pieces and is heavy.  The guys had it up and running in no time and we have enjoyed some serious, often hilarious ping pong since getting the table. The table plays well and it looks good in our space.  We have not folded the table for storage as yet, because we use it almost daily, but that was another feature in deciding on this particular table - the halves nest together and it can be rolled out of the way. I'm sure that will be just as easy as putting it together.  The wheels are good quality and lock securely in place.  I recommend this table for home or office use.
I'm not affiliated with STIGA or amazon and was not compensated for this review.  Purchased the STIGA Advantage Competition-Ready Indoor Ping Pong Table a couple of weeks ago.  So far it's great.  Buy paddles and balls ahead of time, they are not included with the table.  The alligator clips that hold the net to the table are quite strong and help keep the two slabs in place.  Nice, smooth bounce surface.  Purchase on Amazon was easy, delivery arrived on time, set-up was easy - took about 20 minutes, basically 8 nuts and bolts that need to be put in place and tightened.  Helpful to have two of your own wrenches or two sets of pliers to tighten everything, as no tools are included.  Possible to flip the tables right-side up alone once everything is tightened, but much easier to do with it with two people.  As noted in other customer reviews, the two slabs arrive in a single, large, heavy box - two people can lift it, but it would be tough to lift it alone.  Ask the delivery team to bring the box into whichever room you plan to do set-up and play.
Our table has gotten a lot of use in the last 2 months. So far its holding up very well. Folds up and stores very easily. Did come with a few minor imperfections but overall very nice.
This table is ok. Our kids are 11 & 9 yo and we enjoy playing ping pong on it. However, the brackets underneath the table are not secure. Most of them were off when we received it and we are unable to screw back into the table, they fall off again or are only partially attached, see pictures.
I recently ordered the STIGA table tennis.  Couldn't be happier with the delivery and set up  Table was packed securely and stable in box. I chose this particular table because I needed easy assembly, instructions were a breeze. As they stated two large pieces are put together, just had to  put on wheeled legs. Then adjusted the legs to make sure table was level. Looks great in our game room! Would definitely recommend for average players.
This amazing ping pong table was easily assembled with 8 bolts, 16 washers and 8 nuts.  The table is easy to store vertically, with strong 4" lockable casters to effortlessly roll it into a corner of the room.  I bought this table for a school, and within a few hours, about a dozen elementary and high school students were playing ping-pong merry-go-round and having a hoot.  The excitement and thrill was magical.  What a beautiful table, solidly built and well engineered, so easy to fold up with a very solid latch and store away.  The table has a lovely blue finish and the  quality net is incredibly easy to mount.  The only defect was a rivet that had broken off of one of the net clamps.  I have submitted a picture of the invoice and the defect to the manufacturer online, and have been assured that I will likely be contacted within 24 hours.  I anticipate many years of happy table tennis played on this quality table.
This table was packaged well and was easy to assemble. Each side of the table is pretty heavy so you ideally will have 2 people to move around. Once you get the wheels on one person can roll around. It appears to be well made and had a nice dark blue color. The net goes on easily and is secure. Only problem I had was the delivery guys from Amazon left the table in the middle of the driveway when I asked for it to be left on the front porch.
Assembly: A snap. It took minutes to screw on the wheels, which was the only step necessary. Be careful not to try to stand the table upright with just one person, that can damage the table. Quality: Very good. But if I could do things over, I'd probably spend the extra $50 for the Advantage instead of the Advantage Lite. My table is setup on carpet, and I think the added weight would help with the table's stability. Aesthetics: Beautiful. Storage/Folding: The table folds in seconds and has a high quality latch to secure it upright. It's tall so tipping could be an issue if you have small children. I may rig up since straps to eliminate the risk when stored. I love that the table is two separate pieces, so it can be stored with a smaller footprint than other tables where both table top sections connect to a single frame. Playability: Great bounce to the ball, a joy to play on.
Overall, I am very happy with the purchase of the advantage pro.  I decided to buy the heavier and studier table because one of my friends like to dive on the table at times and it has stood up to his 350 lb on multiple occasions.  It plays well for family and friends skill levels and is a great buy for $500.  Pay the $20 for home delivery!  A special delivery service brought my table and there was no damage to the top at all and they carried down a flight of steps for me.  There is small damage the sheet metal that connects one set of the legs, but not bad enough for me to wait another 3 weeks for a new one to be delivered.  This thing is 3/4" particle board and the thicker steel and the two delivery guys had to take it out of the box because of the weight.  I would highly recommend for playing with family and friends... that is my skill level.
We have a couple of pretty nice ping pong tables at my office, but I wanted to get one to practice on at home. I bought this one based on reviews and it was WORTH IT! I haven't been able to play on it as much as I would like, but the time I have used it has been great. The build quality is top notch: the wheels, frame, top, and even the net all feel like they are well built and will last a long time. Playing on the table is great, the ball bounces just right and everything was level right out of the box. I love the look and feel of the table too; the dark blue with black frame looks nice and it folds up very compact, making it easy to store in front of my car in the garage when not in use. If you're looking for one of the best ping pong tables under $500 out there, you've found it. This is a great buy!
My wife and I play ping pong every night in our garage.  This product literally came out of the box with very little assembly required.  It is a high quality indoor table and the best part is how easy it is to fold each side up and simply move it to the side of the garage if I need the space for something else.  Setting it up literally takes 1 minute.  I love the net set up as well.  This is an awesome product and I highly recommend it.
Was damaged on arrival. I am working through the process of getting some parts replaced. Overall I am disappointed with the quality. The casters on the wheels are lopsided, so when you move the table you have to relevel it. The hinges to fold table are flimsy and my kids will break them if not careful. I like how compact it is when it is folded. I like the style, it just feels cheep.
Update to previous review after the Stiga offer to send free balls after a positive review and they never sent them to us and it has been over three months, lowering from 5 stars to 4 stars. This was delivered to my house on the day specified.  When it first arrived in a flat box I was worried about "some assembly required".  However, everything is fully assembled other than connecting four short posts with the wheel assemblies, which took about 10 minutes by myself.  It seems to be of very good quality and we're looking forward to playing tonight.  It looks great also and a fabulous price.  One note is it is rather heavy and you'll need two people to carry each of the two halves, since all of the metal supports are already attached and add to the weight.
We are very pleased with the table. It arrived within the promised time window and the package tracking was exceptional. We assembled it in the garage and then it was easily wheeled into the house in two halves. It took less than 30 minutes to assemble and the process was extremely straight forward. We probably could have assembled it in 15 minutes but I was having the kids help. There was no damage during delivery. The playing surface is great, the net is tight. Very happy with our purchase!
The Shipping for a product that is 180 LBS should be made CLEAR. Was contacted today by freight company saying that only thing paid for was to open up the Semi and I go get it off of it.  Best case they slide it off the bed to me.  HA!  Can you imagine catching that? Update.  They delivered and slid it off a truck.  Luckily it worked out and I had an extra set of hands to move. Table easy to assemble and works.
Great table. Very easy to assemble. Took us less then 15-20mins. Only disappointment was part of the frame arrived bent as though something heavy was placed on the box before it arrived. Other then that the quality seems great. Legs seem very stable. Im glad we didnt go with a cheaper table.
I received the product with three problems below and attached screenshots for the same. 1) Paint below came out the moment I unpacked it after receiving it from amazon. 2) When joining two tables should be joining together but this one not. I have to put a wood below to make it proper. 3) The net is too high with a lot many problems.
Very solid table for a great price. We love that it folds for storage. The net clamp is excellent and holds the net tight without needing to adjust it before playing (as we did with our previous table). My husband is an avid player and has recommended this table to his friends.
This pingpong table by Tiga is the jack of all trades! The quality of the table is amazing and very well made. It appears to be very durable and perfect for all players. It did not take long to assemble and is easy to disassemble. My children and I love playing on this table and really enjoy how nice it is. A definite buy!
Good quality table. When I received the package, I opened it to see the blue table top had numerous scratches. I've called customer service to see if I could purchase some blue touch up paint that they offer, not once was I able to talk to a live person, just been put on hold every time. I paid a lot of money for something that looks used. I'd think twice before purchasing if I were you.
Nice table but all the trim pieces have loose screws and wont stay in the table. I will need to glue them in or something. The holes must be too big. They are trim pieces on the bottom.
Seems like a quality table.  Especially like the net set up and adjustability.  The only negative is that I wish there was some hooks or catches to keep the two parts of the table together.  The net clamps do ok, but some other method to hold the two sections together would be nice.  The finish is nice and it looks and plays great.
I ordered this table specifically because of the 5 star rating from Amazon customers. It was delivered with out any blemishes and all parts. My wife and I assembled the table is about 15-20 minutes, that included unpacking the boxes. It was not only easy to assemble but the instructions were also simple. We were playing 30 minutes after delivery. This is a high quality table among the lower price ranges. It is easy to move and lock down. This was my wife's birthday present,she is 65 tomorrow. Thank you STIGA and Amazon for offering this table at such a good price and free delivery, fast and free I might add.
So far, we're very happy with our table. We have already had a couple dings from normal use on corners and I've touched up with a little clear nail polish to help protect the spots. The net system is nice and the table has a good feel to it.
great feature of the STIGA Advantage, particularly if you have little ones running around, is the spring loaded safety latch system. The safety latch system engages when either table half is positioned vertically, thereby preventing any spontaneous falls. So you can rest at ease that the ping pong table wont fall down on top of you when you open the closet its stored in. And, if youre short on time, or if youre like most of us, and detest assembling just about anything, the STIGA Advantage comes 95% already assembled. The last 5% takes under 10 minutes to put together. Compared to many other tables on the market, this convenient feature is nothing to sneeze at.
This table is awesome. Easy to put together. The directions say assembly will take 10 minutes and it did!. I wish the net a flush with the table - the net is suspended over the table and appears to be higher than it should be. The ball actually goes under the net at times. The table is of good quality and our team loves it and it's convenient to move and store. We did have an issue with shipping - it ended up being delivered a week later than expected - good thing shipping was free.
This table is by far the best I've ever played on. I purchased this because my previous table became worn down and started warping and peeling. I know this table is going to last a long time and that's why it's worth the extra money although it is pricey. The build quality is great and will ensure it's stability with all the use it will receive. If you are considering purchasing a table, this is one of the best out there and if you can't afford this one, the lite is always a great option as well.
I comparison shopped extensively and settled on this table and am glad I did. Amazon's delivery went smoothly, to an upstairs room, for only an additional $20 or so. Table is solid, folds easily (for single-play), and is nice looking. Full-sized, as well. My only complaint is that the corners are sharp, so I stuck little felt pads on each of the four corners (cut from felt furniture pads/glides), which has worked great.
We got this table tennis table as a Christmas gift for our daughters. It was very easy for me to assemble with a little help from my wife. It is well constructed and such great quality. And it has become a great family activity for all of us. I can not recommend it enough!
This was an excellent purchase.  The table is easy to move around when assembled and put into its standing position.  It plays very well; love the "one half up" mode for solo practice.  The blue color works well; easy on the eyes.  Takes up very little space when folded up for out of the way storage.  No negatives so far and don't foresee any at this point.  If you're looking for a good recreational table that can be put up when not in use -- this is the one!
We were thinking to buy a table tennis table for a while. Earlier Costco had a Kettler table on sale for $100 discount. However, when we decided to buy, the sale expired. I checked Amazon and found this table, much cheaper, with great review. I received the table as promised. The table was very well protected. It is very easy to assemble. In about 20 minutes, the table was ready for play. It is of high quality, good looking and fun to play on. I definitely recommend this product.
Beautiful table, well-made and easy to assemble. As usual super- fast delivery with Amazon Prime. I also got the free option to get it delivered to an area of my choosing. We set it up in garage and have been enjoying hours upon hours of fun with it. It is so sturdy, easy to set the leveling in case your space isn't leveled. All our friends who have played on it have complimented us about how lovely it is. The blue color is definitely our favorite over other green tables. Definitely recommend and I have high standards so don't often find things worthy of 5 stars. Get it in time for summer and enjoy many hours of fun with your kids.
The Stiga Advantage Lite is a solid value ping pong table.  In the garage, setup took approximately 30 minutes from box cutting to play.  (Note, using only the Allen key provided in the packaging will take longer; recommend using a standard wrench for gripping the nut while tightening.) .  I appreciated the premium build quality of the table and legs/joints.  Once setup, leveling the table was a snap.  It stores easily as well.  Recommended.
Great recreational table.  Packaging was damaged when it arrived, so I was a little concerned that there would be missing parts, but internal packaging was intact.  Able to get it into the basement with two people and assembly instructions were clear and concise.  Good to have two people when flipping over the assembled halves, but not necessary.  Table surface plays well and net is easy to install and remains tight.
A couple of spots in the cardboard had ripped during delivery.  Unfortunately one hole resulted in a pretty good chunk out of the table.  Thankfully it is on the underside of the table.  I didn't bother to contact Amazon or Stiga.  I had no desire to go through the hassle of returning the table for a replacement.  It's surprising to me that there was no barrier between the table and the cardboard.  I would expect that damage happens quite frequently during shipping with the way it was packaged. As for the table itself, it seems to be well made.  Set up was super easy as many others have described.  Overall I recommend it and would purchase it again.
The STIGA Advantage Competition-Ready Indoor Table Tennis Table is an outstanding table for recreational home use. The construction is solid, the playing surface is level and clean, and the net is well positioned and stays in place. I took advantage of Amazon home setup (which was included for free in my offer), so I can't speak to the difficulty of setting it up myself; it took the assembler about an hour. My children and I have spent countless hours having fun playing on the Stiga. Our skills have improved considerably through practice and we look forward to playing for years to come!
We received our table on time and in good condition. Set up was relatively easy but heavy for my wife and I being 70.  Still, we managed to complete it in a little over 40 minutes. We immediately started playing and the table has exceeded our expectations, especially for the price.  The table is built well and and plays as well as tables costing much more. Very satisfied.
I come from a family with no assembly skills.  So after I had saved up enough to a ping pong table, I took the time to read reviews and consumer opinions--looking for something that would be simple to construct. I knew in all honesty that if i couldn't construct it right, i wouldn't be able to use it, so I paid more than I had anticipated wanting something easy to build.  I can attest that the reviews on this table are accurate--it is easy to construct!  I had all the pieces I needed and no damage occurred to the table during shipping. The box it is mailed in is reinforced with wood to protect the table.  Mine was 100% fine!  Very satisfied with this product.  Have played on it regularly since purchase, with no concerns.  :) -Happy and satisfied customer
Great table! Play the on this table is wonderful. Well made and looks good. It was very easy to put together; only took about 20 minutes. Entire family loves it. I highly recommend this table. Well worth the extra money over the cheaper tables! Update: January 2018. There are screws that keep falling out from the bottom of the table. I screw them back in just to have them fall back out. It is still usable but worried it will fall apart.
Extremely pleased with the purchase of the STIGA Advantage Table Tennis Table! After researching table tennis tables I loved the STIGA because of the great reviews and the clear and concise information on the Amazon listing. It was delivered on the date promised and came carefully packed and very well protected. I was able to assemble it myself with no issues and then required the help of my husband to pick up the table and stand it up. The table is very sturdy and has a smooth, flat, and even playing surface. My kids play every day and we've even had family tournaments. I love the fact that it is so easy to fold for storage or playback mode. I recommend this table for anyone looking for a high quality, professional, and beautiful table tennis table.
Just got the table, seems very sturdy and looks beautiful. Came in one big, heavy box on time.  I opened the box in the garage and brought the two table halves in separately which were much more manageable. It was almost totally together, all I had to do was attach the wheels.  You need both a 13 and a 14 mm wrench.  The table is easy to open and close with one person. The net was very easy to attach and easy to tighten by yourself, much better than the net I grew up with. Definitely worth spending the extra money to get a good table.
Very impressed with this Stiga Advantage table.  Well built and sturdy.  Included a good quality clamp on net. Set up only involves placing the wheels (brackets/legs) to each side and then fold out and ready to play.  Probably only needs 2 people to remove the table from the packaging and lift up to playing position.  After that, the fold away feature for storage is very easy and only 1 person needed to flip the table up into storage position and roll away.  I think its a very good table for the price in the beginner and intermediate level play.
The table was delivered about a week after I ordered it.  The package is very heavy but the delivery people placed it where I asked.  I was impressed by how efficiently the parts were packed in the box and how well protected the package was.  The table halves definitely require at least 2 people to move them and put them into position for final assembly.  The instructions were straightforward and I was surprised at how little additional assembly was needed - only attaching the roller leg extensions.  Two adjustable wrenches are needed to tighten the bolts if you don't have a metric set.  The only confusing part of the assembly was how to tension the string that runs through the top of the net.  I found a YouTube video that showed a setup for a similar net and it clued me in that the metal ball chains at the ends of the strings needed to fit into notches in the net brackets, but the string was too long.  I shortened the string enough by retieing the knot holding the chain so that I could tension the string.  It's a minor point but it could have been explained in the manual.  I've only played on the table a few times since I set it up but it's been great.  The bounce appears to be uniform over the entire surface and the net doesn't sag.  I like the blue color though I was used to playing on the traditional green tables.I expect to use it for many years.
The table is very good. Very well packaged. Nice surface and good bounce. Easy to assemble. Read to play under 30 minutes. The delivery was terrible. Delivery guys did not call to confirm, neither knocked my door at the time of delivery. I left the whole driveway empty for them to leave the table. They ended up leaving the table on the front yard ruining a blooming flower bed. On the table side, don't have any complaints. For the price paid, would have been nice, if it had a storage compartment for paddles and balls.
This table kicks ass!!!! Its funny when you read all the reviews of what people complain about!!! We are so stoked on this table and we have had so much fun over the last couple of weeks. Its a high-quality table that maneuvers and works perfectly when put away!!! We purchased a cover to keep it nice inside the garage. Its a great space saver also for its size it fits everywhere!!!
I can't tell you how happy I am with this this table. First off it is very heavy in the package you will need two people to help move it. Putting it together is very simple it pretty much comes 90% assembled in the box what little that needs to be done is easy to do. The table is two big pieces that fold up nicely vertically to save room. I also purchased the Stiga cover for it and keep the table outside under a lanai against a wall and when ready to play just take off the cover fold down the two table pieces attach the net that just easily clip on and is very sturdy and start to play. This all can be done in less than 5 minutes. The wood and metal parts this table is made with is all high quality. But last and not least my favorite part is the blue and white paint job this table has, it's just gorgeous to look at. You just can't go wrong with this table.
For all of you ping pong fans, my review.  I'm a 78 year old female who, along with my great grandson and the help of a neighbor older than myself, was able to get this table out of the box and assembled in less than 30 minutes.  Most of the parts were already either already assembled or, the assembly required was minimal.  My thanks to STIGA for a great product that's already being enjoyed by both young and old and that didn't take an army to put together.
The delivery was impeccable, the product did not have one dent or scratch. The table is composed of two individual tables, which I found convenient for assembly and maneuverability. Don't worry, they align perfectly, forming a smooth surface,  once you place the net. It was also very easy to assemble (2 people, so half the time) although, as you can see in the first picture, we had an extra helper :p
This company has a promotion for table tennis balls for feedback about their table. I bought this for my kids and they love it.  No concerns with quality so far.  Looks and feels like a higher end table. Some tips when getting this table.  If you cannot lift a bulky 80 pound table I would recommend getting in home delivery.  I was able to bring it to the basement by myself but do not advise for others to try.  Also, make sure you tighten the leg bolts with wrench and ratchet.  Do not leave it loose.  It takes around 30min to assemble by youself.
I am not an expert but I have been playing on a super crappy table for so long that this is like the Cadillac of tables lol. Great table, super quick and easy assembly, it IS really heavy so unless you're a really strong person you WILL need at least one person to help. The delivery was also great, no blemishes on my new table. Totally happy customer!! Thank you!
The engineering and construction of this equipment is very impressive. It took about a half hour to attach the wheels to the two table frames. Two strong backs are needed to turn the table over onto its legs. The pieces are heavy.  Having two socket wrenches is also very helpful, although I suppose one could put the legs together with two pair of pliers. After one failed delivery that never came, the second one I ordered came exactly  as scheduled. This table should be used for lots of family fun. Glad I bought it.
This Stiga ping pong table is FANTASTIC. I researched mid-range ping pong tables for weeks determining which one is the highest quality for the lowest price (under $500). The choice came down to either the Joola Inside or the Stiga Advantage, with the Stiga getting the nod from most reviewers. I took a leap of faith and ordered the Stiga Advantage and I am really happy with my choice. The packaging was excellent with no visible damage to the table upon arrival, the assembly process was extremely simple (took me about 15 minutes including reading instructions), and the craftsmanship of the table and net are really impressive. I love how small this table folds up in my garage.
We put this in the two car garage and it folds so thin that when we need the garage it feels nothing is there! Sometimes a minor issue when unfolding it but when you learn how to do it, then no issues. I wish there was a coating on the surface to protect from scratches. Over all I would definitely but this again and recommend it.
From the outset:  My delivery appointment got screwed up, but the trucker got it here less than a full day late, so not bad. . .. Out of the box:  The table is well packed, and well protected.  There was damage to the box outside which seemed to have cut into some wood -- but the company has actually packed the table inside a cardboard box that's reinforced with wood (or pressboard) at edges and on the sides.  Very helpful -- the table came out looking just fine. From there:  The claims that's it's very easy to set up are absolutely true.  You literally just put the table halves upside down on the floor, open the leg assemblies (very simple), and put 8 bolts through metal legs and braces -- no confusion is possible here -- and tighten them up.  Then you flip the table halves, put them together -- very easy to move the halves on the two wheeled legs -- and clamp on the net where they join.  My one concern about assembly was that just rolling the two halves together might not create a level table across the join.  But it got very close to perfect before the net clamps, and the clamps do a good job of finishing that off. On my floor, there was no need to level, but the legs have levelers just in case. The "finished" product is very solid, looks good, and plays very well.  Good bounce, etc.  The whole family found ourselves smiling and laughing within moments. I'm sure that a much more expensive table from a good manufacturer must have some advantages.  But for a reasonably priced, non-professional table, we are very happy with this one!
My wife and I wanted a nice entry level table to pick up table tennis again after years away from it. We chose this one based on the reviews, and for the price, we are extremely happy with it. It was very well packed, and as the product description says, it's 95% assembled, the only thing we needed to do was attach the wheel sets to the four legs that they go on; this only takes about 10-15 minutes (you'll need a couple of wrenches, 8mm bolts and nuts). Folding and unfolding the two sections is very quick and easy for storage, and the table surfaces themselves seem very durable. We had to move the sections from upstairs to our basement, and despite some minor (accidental) bumps going down our narrow basement stairway, the finish wasn't hurt at all. The hardware is very sturdy and the enclosed instructions are very clearly written. For a starter level full size table, this was an excellent choice. The playing surface and the table hardware look to be very sturdy for years of use. A note about the packaging. You should be aware that it comes in a very large and heavy package. About 5 feet by four and a half feet by 5 or 6 inches, and around 250 pounds. The best idea on receiving it would be to unpack it after you get in the door and move the sections separately. The packaging itself contains a lot of cardboard wrapped MDF sections, the top and bottom of the carton are lined with it as well (one of the reasons it arrived in excellent shape), plus if you unpack it you can remove the smaller carton with the wheels and mounting hardware, which is also a few pounds. The individual table sections are separate in the box, and much easier to move individually than trying to move the whole thing.
The delivery process was very smooth - timing confirmed and completed without any issues.  When I opened the box I was pleased to see how protected the tabletops were and that the box was fortified with masonite on both of the inner box surfaces and the corners were protected as well, there was not a mark on either of the playing surfaces!  Install took me (60 yr old female DIY'er) about 1hr and then I tried it out with a single player practice session!  Great table - would recommend it to others!
Full disclosure:  They give you free ping pong balls if you write a review.  That being said, this was a good purchase.  It comes substantially assembled.  You just add the legs to each half and flip it over.  It takes two people to carry the box and it's probably a good idea to have someone else help you flip so you don't damage the legs. The table looks great, it's got a great blue color with clean lines and no distracting logos or markings.  The table top is probably too thin for serious players but for me and my kids, it does the trick.  The price was reasonable. My only con was the shipping service ignored the time window submitted completely.  They showed up four hours early, luckily someone was home.
Love this table, is very sturdy,nice looking table.  The grandkids are having a lot of fun playing also.  Great family fun. Did have a little piece missing to the net but customer service was awesome and refunded more than enough to replace the net.  Very happy with the new premium net.  My husband was a little skeptical about having to carry the box to the basement and putting it together.  But the description said 95% assembled and that was perfect,  They had it together in about 15 min.  And delivery was a breeze too as they carried it down to the basement.  Very happy with this product.  Is good exercise and so much fun.
Very excited to finally have table tennis in my home. Decent price for a starter table. As in the description, it does come mostly all put together, which is a plus. However, I had a couple issues. 1.) The folding hinge on one side was not put on correctly on one of the tables. When I attempted to move it, the screws fell out. While I was able to get the hinge in the right place and screw the bracket on, I wonder how this will effect the fold of the table. 2.) On the opposite side of the above mentioned hinge, the screws came completely off. Im unable to screw them in all the way and I imagine they will fall out as well. While structurally not making too much of a difference in the table, it was concerning to have them fall out and makes me wonder what else will happen as I begin to use the table more, making me uneasy about my purchase.
The setup of this table was so easy! We planned our whole evening to put it together but all you have to do is put two screws into each leg to attach the wheels. So instead of spending our evening pouring over instructions, we got to play ping pong on our new table! We love the clamps that hold the net tight and that there is a string going through the top of the net that you can tighten to make sure the net stays taught. The quality of the table is also astounding. The design is so sleek and the table top is very sturdy and good quality. We love this table and hope it will last us many many years.
My husband and I really love our new table tennis set-up. Delivery was easy and I'm glad we paid extra to bring it to the final location within our home (one flight of stairs with a u-turn style bend). Assembly was quick and straightforward following the instructions provided. The table is smooth and flat - we were worried it might get scratched or warp during delivery - but the packaging protected it well. It's so nice having a table at home now so we can play whenever we want. We are practicing a skill and keeps us from sitting too long on the couch on weeknight evenings. Definitely recommend this Stiga table.
This is our familys first ping pong table, its great to play on. Unfortunately setup involved a trip to the hardware store because the bolts shipped were too short (50mm instead of 55mm). Also when turning it over to play make sure you have a second set of hands. I tried to do one side by myself and the brace brackets pulled out of the bottom of the table.
Oh my gosh!  After doing a lot of research on various tennis tables I decided to go with the Stiga Advantage.  I had originally considered an outdoor table since this is being used on our covered/screened Florida lania and out of the elements.  Due to the additional price and limited availability, I decided to go with this indoor table and keep it covered.  This table took me about 20 -30 minutes to assemble.  The construction is very well done and looks great.  I wanted something that would last along time for my wife and I to be able to play, as well as our adult children and grandchildren to enjoy when they came to visit.  It is perfect.  It's easy to fold up and store when not being used and I did purchase the indoor/outdoor Stiga cover to protect it.  Very well worth the money, we have already enjoyed several hours of playing and laughing together. The Amazon delivery team was awesome, called to verify the delivery time was still good with us and they brought it all the way around to our back lania.  Very professional and polite.  Would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great table and not wanting to pay a lot of money.
I love how it folds up and rolls out of the way. The assembly was super easy. I had to get a buddy over to help me lift the surfaces off the ground, it's really heavy. But he didn't have to help me assemble it. That part took a few minutes. High quality, I can tell it's well-made. Sturdy. I don't know much about ping pong, but I think this is a good table. We sure are having fun with it.
We received our second table in perfect condition...the first was damaged, but it was very easy to return and receive a new one.  Amazon was outstanding with this!!  The table itself is very good quality.  It assembles well and did not need further adjustments.  The table top is also perfect for a nice bounce.  And the net has a good tension to it.  It folds very nicely and does not take up much room in our garage.  It is so easy to unfold and play and fold again.  We had a really fun ping pong tournament at our family lake house.  the men loved it!!!  We definitely recommend this table!!
Been using this table a lot after purchase. Love the design and the stability of the table. Very easy to put and take off the net. Very easy to assemble. The best feature, to me, is the way this folds up. There is a nice audible click that tells you the table is not going to fall back on you. I realized this was a really cool design when I got a chance to compare this to another older (and more expensive) model from Stiga at my friend's place. It took two adults to safely and securely put that fold that one back. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is that it lacks a ball rack (some models have them). Makes it easy to pick up another ball rather than using your pockets to hold the next one to serve.
The table was easy to assemble, it took less than 10 minutes with my husband and I putting it together.  We have had the table for almost a year and it has held up very well.  There are no scratches, dents, etc that have shown up on the table after about a year of use, so it seems very durable.  It is also easy to fold in half so that you can play yourself using the other side as a backboard.  Highly recommend this for people who want a quality ping pong table that will last!
Totally worth the bit extra $$s. I originally ordered the JOOLA Indoor 15mm Ping Pong Table. It was delivered without the required hardware for assembly. It was also very slightly damaged at the corners. Ended up returning to Amazon for a full refund and they offered a $50 voucher which I applied to the purchase of the STIGA table. Amazon. customer service was outstanding. And the STIGA table is absolutely superb.
We ordered this table to replace a "Bargain" one whose assembly and playability were somewhat lacking.  The company that delivered the product was excellent.  They navigated it down an icy hill so that it could be brought into yhe basement directly. Assembly was a breeze, insert and tighten eight bolts, flip and you're done.  I was a bit concerned/intigued by the design of two independent half tables.  My concern was their ability to have both sides be on the same plane, but with a flat floor and sturdy well enginered table supports, that was not an issue. The  table is eminently playable and so far has provided us with  many hours of enjoyment. The only con I could think of is that the wheel locks seemed a bit tight, but I imagine with a little bit of oil, they could be easier to manipulate.
I recommend this product 100%.  It is shipped with wood around it....be sure to remove it from the box prior to taking up or down stairs as the wood makes it very heavy,  The table was in top notch condition and easy to assemble.  Balls and paddles not included.  I am VERY pleased!
This table is extremely well made, beautiful to look at, and plays great.  After reviewing options for a table, very pleased with this choice.  This is more expensive than some of the other options I considered, but you get what you pay for.  This table plays smooth, has a thick top, and the blue color is very pleasant to look at.  As important, this table is well engineered from a construction standpoint.  The table came 90% pre assembled which is very helpful when precision assembly is critical to performance.  The fact that it's in two pieces makes it super easy to fold up and store.  It literally takes 30 seconds to set up and break this table down.  I also appreciate the clamp-based net system - very well done and convenient.  Finally, table was shipped problem free and no defects.
I'm a picky consumer. I'm willing to pay for a certain quality and I expect that quality. I was nervous about the whole delivery thing but took a shot and very pleased. At first, some of the packaging was slightly torn around the edges but it was quickly noticable that Stiga includes appropriate hard packaging/protection. Table assembled in 15 minutes, every piece was there and fit perfectly. I did take my time and read the directions; although straight forward it's worth following them for a few subtleties about the living mechanism, legs, when to lock the legs, unlock, etc. Very durable and we'll made. I actually really like the net and system included. Money well spent!
Very nice table.  Did not notice any differences between this table and the more expensive ones I use at the ping pong club.  Easy to assemble and folds up compactly with the 2 separate halves.
Box arrived looking like it had a partial stab wound, delivery guys put that side face down :-) No damage from the puncture though as it was not a blow to any hardware or the table. As we were setting it up damage to one of the plastic corner inserts was noted. With a toddler in the house, that's unfortunate. We'll be getting a replacement part ASAP I hope. Also, one of the lock nuts was warped so I had to make a run to the hardware store to complete the setup. Sets up easy, glad we opted for the thicker model. Plays nice yet very easy to un-hinge, fold up, roll around, etc. I'd give this a 5 if it wasn't for the lack of hardware QC and the damage. If we get replacement corner part easy, I'll bump the rating up.
Nice table but very poor quality control. Several screws attaching the frame to the table fell out.  I could not screw them back in as they no longer would hold into the pressboard.  I used a clear silicon glue to secure the table to the frame.
This is a great table tennis table, and amazing value for the money.  Sturdy and solid so it gives a professional style bounce and sound to the ball.  It was extremely easy to assemble, attachment of the four wheel sets being all that is required.  The net is easy to attach, and keeps the two halves together very effectively. It folds up easily with a solid "click" for storage, and occupies a relatively small space - we are ordering a cover for it.  The table is a nice color, and very pleasing aesthetically. It was drop-shipped to us.  We got a call 30 minutes before delivery (as promised), and they arrived exactly 30 minutes later.  Its was drop shipped without any damage.  Great job. My son and I are now enjoying this table tennis table.  It is tremendous value for the money.
The whole family LOVES it and it's great to have on hand for family events! We got this table for our dad's Father's Day surprise...our parents were playing and laughing like kids for hours. Worth every penny. 5 stars for assembly -- they're not kidding about it coming 95% assembled. All we really had to do was put on the wheels. 5 stars for aesthetics -- love the slate blue color 4.5 stars for quality -- the table is quality itself is amazing, but I think one of the rubber pieces that cover the corner of the table was cracked during the move -- no biggie and nothing super glue can't fix. I would highly recommend this table for any age and level of play.
Great table. Very sturdy. Great quality surface. solid construction. Very easy to put together. I did it by myself, but if you had two people, it's that much easier and faster. Fold up and put away is simple and quick. Net clamps stay straight, are easy to adjust, and keep the two table tops level and consistent. This was a big deal for me from past experience. I would highly recommend this table.
Table came in in great shape and was easily assembled by myself in about 15 minutes!  Just a matter of attaching the levelers and the portion of the legs that hold the castors.  Well worth the few extra dollars over the ones that advertise 70% assembled.  Table is stable and great for our purpose.....family usage. Scheduled inside delivery is nice too as the shipping package is too heavy and awkward for one person to handle.
I have this table about for a week now. And I gotta say its worth every penny. I bought this table during the Amazons "deal of the day" which was 100 dollars cheaper than the original price. First thing first, t was very easy to assemble! It took us less than 30 mins. Second, even though the shipment was damaged, like they were scratches/holes on the shipment box, nothing ever actually happened to the table. It was packed very tightly in the box so that you wouldn't get scratches on the corners or on top of the table.
This seems like a good table for the money except for one glaring feature: the two halves of the table are not connected by a latch or clamp. I was able to buy a couple of clamps from Harbour Freight to remedy the problem but think this is a major design flaw. Although table was well packed and easy to assemble, it arrived with some minor damage.
Easy to assemble (10 minutes), beautiful, stable and effortless to fold and move around. The fact that the clamps of the net serves also to level the two sides of the table is perfect! Adding to my previous comments, I want to mention that the Customer Service of the vendor Escalade Sports is fantastic! I had lost one small part of my net and they went above and beyond, sending me a whole new net for free. Special thanks to Katie Ward!
Great item during this pandemic as another good activity at a good price.  Easy to assemble. Box was beat up but no damage to table.  Surprisingly easy to assemble. Surface has a nice finish.
This is a great table for my family of amateur players. The construction of everything -- table, legs, casters, net clamps, and net -- is very solid and feels like professional quality. Be aware, though, that the cost of high quality construction is extra weight, and this table is HEAVY. DO NOT disregard the many warnings on the box and in the instructions about steps requiring more than one person. Because it's regulation size, each half of the table is 4.5' by 2.5' and this gets very unwieldy to handle for a single person. That said, I totally disregarded those directions and while I did manage to drag each half down my (carpeted) stairs and put the thing together alone, I ended up scratching the side against one of the staples in the outer packaging because I had to set one of the halves down. Cosmetic, but annoying.
After looking, reading, and researching we decided upon the STIGA competition-ready table. Build is great quality. Assembly only took about 20 minutes. I was a little surprised at how heavy it was to move into the house, hence the quality of the materials. The box with protective packaging must have weighed 20 lbs. We have a large carpeted game room and we are glad we got the 3" wheels. It is easy to collapse and push across the room. We had family over the first day and must have played for 4-5 hours. Keep in mind there are no racquets/paddles or balls included.
this is a nice table .easy to assemble. quality product. but....after unpacking it, lugging it down to the basement, and assembling it, we saw that the top was actually cracked for about 2 feet, resulting in it tilting down one  side by 1/8 of an inch. it must have sustained an incredible whack on the side. i had already broken down the packaging, and there was no visible damage to the box, so we are living with it  as we are not serious players, and the carrier will deny liability. sending it back is a real burden  as we would have to bring it back up a difficult stair.  but this is substantial and unacceptable damage for a good table. we are very unhappy.
The table came in a tightly packed box. It's heavy for one person for sure. The assembly was extremely easy enough that my 19 yr old son assembled it without any intervention. That tells me that the assembly instructions are well written. The table looks nice in our basement. Very easy to move around due to the wheels at the bottom. All in all, an excellent ping pong table for beginners like my family.
Very good bounce and sturdily built. We put it in the garage folded at night. During the day, after move the car outside,  it took just one minute to setup. We enjoy the table almost every day. If you have more money,  buy the thicker model for it is more bouncy
This product ruined Christmas for our family. It was a Santa gift that he could not complete Christmas eve. The holes were too small for the screws so it couldnt be assembled. Ruined both kids and parents holiday. Thanks.
+1 - Item arrived on time, and not damaged +1 - Item is as described +3 - Table works as intended, is well made, and we are enjoying it Thoughts: This table was very easy to put together. I put it together by myself, though the instructions says to have 2 people. It didn't take me more than 30 minutes. I did go back and check all of the screws that were done by the manufacturer and found a couple that needed a little extra torque. The included clamp down net is nice, much  better than the screw clamp style nets of the past. This table is really well made, and it's very easy to fold up and move out of the way by yourself. We have enjoyed hours of competition on this table, and will for the foreseeable future.
Our Stiga Advantage table arrived well packaged and in good condition. Assembly was straight forward, the blue table looks great in our basement rec room, and the table plays well and sits level (with some adjustment of the feet). Be forewarned that the table is very heavy - at least for my wife and I who are in our 60s:) We unpacked the contents outside and then brought each separate half of the table down down to the basement. I'm a bit compulsive so between unpacking, reading the assembly instructions, set-up and leveling, it probably took us around an hour to be completely finished and playing. We're very pleased with our purchase and look forward to years of ping-pong fun with friends and family.
This is a great ping pong table.  For those of you who are considering keeping this in a garage, that's where we keep ours, and there is no discernible difference in the quality of the parts or playing surface (now having survived its first harsh Midwest winter). The table was packaged very well so as not to incur any damage in transit.  If you have it delivered on your porch like I did, you'll definitely need another person to help move it - it is very heavy in the box.  That said, it ended up taking longer to break down the packaging it came in than it did to actually set up.  Once the box is open it took about 15 minutes to get it set up and ready to play.  Moving the table around is effortless.  Each side of the playing surface folds up and can be rolled away to the side of a room taking up very minimal space considering the size of a ping pong table. Absolutely fantastic, high quality ping pong table for the price.
Ordered on April 30th and a projected delivery date of May 15th, my table didnt arrive until May 22nd due to shipping company confusion. When finally arriving and opening up a badly damaged box, the table top had a chip on the playing surface that can directly effect gameplay if ball hit the area. Im not happy about the long wait time to get my table and certainly not happy to get a damaged tabletop when it did finally show up!
Playability: We decided to have the table in the studio apartment. It's a little too big for the inside space but it's fitting good. Since I play table tennis more seriously than for fun, so I am happy to get the official size table. I can set it up and fold it up by myself if I want to use it alone. Quality: I played ping pong with my partner on the day it arrived. Quality seems nice and I didn't find any complaint. Aesthetics: It looks beautiful and just like any other table tennis. I can not tell a big difference between this one and other tables which are more expensive. I like the table being thin compared to thick table because it looks better and still it seems stable. Assembly: I set it up with my partner and it was easy and smooth. It took about 30-45 min from receiving,unpacking, to assembling. There is a correct way to open the box it comes in with the printed top facing up. The instruction was easy to follow, but you do need to have two sets wrenches (one adjustable and one for the nut) It will be hard to assemble by yourself because you have to flip the table after putting wheels.
Great table!! Easy to set up- you only need a good crescent wrench and some pliers. Like others said, the leg with the wheels rests n top of the other, but you put braces in either side then fasten the braces in place with bolts. Table is easy to fold and move. The two halves go together and one of my halves were a tad higher than the other, but once I attached the net, the two tables were even. Does not come with paddles or balls.
The cross bar attached to the legs of the frame assembly is  about 3 inches higher on one side than the other side. As a result the leg with casters assembly cannot be attached to one of the legs because the connector piece would not fit. With the help of a hacksaw I was able to modify the connector piece so that the table could be assembled. The table legs are clearly marked as to where the cross bar should be welded to the legs. The defect is apparent to a quick visible inspection. I emailed the company and they notified me that a support representative would be reviewing my request for a replacement of the leg frame assembly and that they were experiencing delays in receiving some of parts which is understandable since the table is made in China. After 5 days of not hearing from the company representative and not wanting to go through the hassle of returning the table , I made the modification to the table.
The table is great. very sturdy, easy to assemble the wheel parts but need two people to unpack and set up.  That said the delivery was totally poor.  When ordering Amazon has you select available time and date.  That selected date, I received communication to "schedule delivery".  The caller denied that I had previously scheduled delivery so I had to reschedule. I have a 250 yard driveway that UPS trucks for example have no problem bringing stuff up to the house, but on the day of this delivery a neighbor stopped in and mentioned that he had earlier seen a rental Enterprise truck drive into the drive then leave.  I explored and 2/3rd down the drive the large 200 lb package was leaning against a shed in the snow.  (the driveway was totally clean and dry).  My wife and I had to tilt it onto a trailer and get it into my garage to protect against a incoming rain storm.  Great product, terrible delivery
The table was well packed. It's also easy to assemble. When we flipped over the table after we finished assembly, however, several screws fell off! They are all from pre-assembled frames. By close inspection, the screw holes are too loose to hold the screws because the wood is too soft. As result the two half tables are not on the same level. One of them is more curved down a bit. Very disappointed!
Decent table. Very easy to assemble. You will need either a wrench or pliers (neither is supplied) to hold nuts with nylon inserts. Fairly heavy, so carrying it up and down the stairs is not a good option for one person. It levels well. Casters are okeyish, seem to be on a cheaper side. The net set is a major disappointment - the net is too short, so when stretched, it pulls clamps up by an inch. As a result, you end up with an inch-wide gap underneath the net and the upper edge being 1 inch higher than the standard. Plan to buy another set unless you dont care about the net height or enjoy a bit of sewing.
We ordered this table to go in the basement for some family fun and to give our son and his friends something to do on rainy/snowy days.  It arrived on time, and while the box was in rather rough shape, everything was in good order upon opening the package.  Assembly was easy as all we needed to provide were two sets of hands and two wrenches/sockets.  I will have to say that it does help to have two adults, as the two halves do take a little bit of muscle to maneuver around before the wheels get put on.  Once assembled the table looked great and I have to say that I was particularly impressed with the net system.  The corners all looked nice, the edges are all sharp, and the lines on the table are straight and true.  Playing on the table so far has been great as the ball bounces predictably and consistently all over the table.  The only problem we've had so far is deciding who gets to play!  All in all, I don't think a family who plays casually, yet competitively, could ask for more from a table.
We purchased this STIGA Advantage table to replace an older table and are completely floored by the quality and ease of assembly. The delivery scheduling process was also very easy and efficient. I originally bought it as a Christmas gift but wanted to assemble it before Christmas thinking it would take some time. To my surprise it only took me about twenty minutes to assemble. Love the way the two sides of the table nest together when in storage also. This is a great table and a great value.
Simply awesome! Its literally just 8 bolts, a net and its assembled! The unit is very heavy! So if you plan on doing it your self you may want to get help! The biggest thing I was worried about was it getting damaged in shipping! I have to say the box took a beating but didnt damage the product! Keep in mind this can happen with large heavy items! The table itself is worth the pro with the 3/4 thick I think this will last awhile and looks to be very well built! Highly recommend and worth the savings!
The product came as described. This would get a 5 star rating but the assemble instructions are a little busy. Especially, the part that about putting on the wheels is confusing. The instructions and picture says FRONT. Unfortunately, there is no label on the legs that indicate which one is the front or back. However, you can see from a picture showing the table folded that the wheels are on the BACK ( I would say BOTTOM ) when folded. Maybe you all should put a sticker / label on the legs. Other than that delay, it took less 30 minutes to assemble with one helper. The table is heavy. So you will need a helper.
We bought this table to replace the cheap 30 year old table in our game room.  I was actually pleasantly surprised at the quality of this table.  The workmanship appears to be of high standards and the table has a nice crisp bounce.  I love how it folds up and actually has a smaller foot print than our old fold-up table.  So far we have enjoyed the table a great deal. Because of the high quality of this table, it is quite heavy.  I used a hand truck to move it from the garage to my basement and should have asked a friend for help.  By the way, hard-board is actually glued onto the packaging to help ensure the table arrives unblemished.  The assembly was simple and only required a couple of 9/16" wrenches.  I had the whole thing up and going in about half an hour. Anyway, we are very happy with the table and would highly recommend it.
I kept going back and forth on these for weeks . . . finally decided on this STIGA Advantage. One corner was missing the plastic sort of "corner guard"  (and I'm too lazy to contact STIGA re. same) but otherwise it's what it's supposed to be.  My 70 yo dad and I got it into the basement without issue (took it down in pieces) he assembled it by himself (he's handy, if that matters to anyone).  I really like how easy it is to fold up against the wall and how compact it is.  The table itself is very sturdy - and probably more than we need (it's just for my kids to have something to do in my renovated basement).  But I was concerned about teenagers getting too rough and like breaking a cheaper tale b/c they horse around.  This one won't break unless someone really takes out a lot of serious aggression on it :)
After extensively reviewing ping pong tables, we decided on the Stiga Advantage and bought it for a family Christmas present. We were able to schedule the delivery time, and it arrived right on time! It was packaged nicely to keep it well protected during shipping. Assembly was very easy but definitely need two people in order to turn each half over after attaching the legs. I love that each half of the table folds up and stands on its own. It wheeled across our carpet really easily as well when we needed to move it to a different room. For play, each piece met perfectly. The table also looks nice in our game room. Incredibly pleased with this purchase, and would highly recommend it.
I am a new player, and got the lite version of the table. The table was delivered from Amazon 1 day late, but with no damage, One of the screw on legs was slightly cross threaded, but otherwise assembly was easy and fast. The slight cross threading isn't worth knocking off a star, but worth noting. Amazons bad choices for delivery partners isn't Stiga's fault. The table itself is really high quality, and is very sturdy when the wheels are locked. The way it folds is also top notch and locks in place when vertical, making storage easy and safe. A pro would likely not want to buy the Lite version as it's slightly thinner, but as a new player I honestly couldn't tell the difference. I would purchase again, great table.
Great decision to get this table. Very impressed with the delivery. Selected to have this delivered straight to our basement and I am glad I did as this is a heavy box. We were given a choice of delivery time window of three hours then they sent a notification reminder the day before and a phone call 30 minutes prior to the scheduled delivery time. It took us about 10 to 15 minutes to install the wheels adjust for leveling and we were up playing. We tested out the play alone feature and it couldn't have been easier to do. It took 30 seconds to set up. Looking forward to great family fun.
First off, the Delivery of the table was flawless, as publicized a call was made to us in advance, the drivers were prompt, professional and brought in right in to my garage. The quality of the table is very good and as described. Assembly was no issue what so ever, less than 30 minutes. The packaging was top notch and prevented the table and other contents from being damaged. As far as aesthetics, the blue iv extremely pleasing, very nice looking table With the great net, balancing legs and portability as a result of the rollers the play-ability is great as the above allows you to perfectly balance the table. Great product, thank you
We did much research for a regulation size table tennis table that met several criteria: Playability and Quality -to be sturdy, functional and easy to play for all levels of players, from our grand kids to fairly serious players; to be easy to assemble; to be reasonably priced; and to be attractive. It has met and surpassed all of these criteria. The table is solid, It took less than 30 minutes to fully set up. Family and friends have enjoyed playing on it for hours at a time.  We love it and would highly recommend it.
This is a great table. We especially like it for how sturdy it is and that we can use the two tables separately for other things if we want. The surface is quality and it looks great. The assembly was quick, done by my husband in about 45 minutes. It looks great in our large finished basement and is made of quality materials. We've had a great time playing on it.
We purchased this table for our garage and we love it. It folds up and down easily, the net clamp is very effective and even levels out the table halves. The surface is great and plays very well. We are extremely happy with our purchase.
Blown away by this table. I wasn't expecting weight, strength, size of this thing. Very sturdy, very durable. I was shocked by how heavy the box was! Make sure you have a few people to help move the box, we ended up opening it up on the front porch and carrying it in piece by piece. The net is sturdy, and it helps hold the two pieces together, and level. The benefits of having two pieces that can move independently vs. one piece is great for maneuverability and storage. Overall, great ping pong table!
Well made and designed.  It was fantastically well packed, in order to survive transit (it did).  Pretty easy to assemble and once assembled, easy to set up for play and break it down again for storage.
Amazon delivery was very good. Assembly was extremely easy. All parts arrived in good order. It looks very sturdy, and though I have no comparison, seems like a good table for the price.
Easy to assemble as my 14 year old did it mostly by himself. Has been durable for us so far. Good fun for all ages.
I am really impressed with the quality of this table tennis set! It is sturdy and well-made. We use this on a daily basis and it still looks new. The table top is a really pretty blue color.  I love that it can fold up to take less space when it's not being used, and I love how easy it is to set up. I love that it can be set up for one player as well.
I'm very happy with my purchase. The table plays very well, with a very consistent bounce. It also looks great! Even when folded and rolled away it is very aesthetically pleasing: the underside is finished and all supports underneath have a nice black coating. Highly recommend!
Table came 95% preassembled and was delivered as scheduled.  It only took me 1 hour to complete the rest of the assembly, which was because I took my time so as to read the instructions completely and not assume anything.  My son and I have played on it everyday and have enjoyed the sturdiness and the ease of being able to fold it up to put it out of the way and the reverse; by the simplicity of setting it back up for play.  We have only had the table for one week but have enjoyed playing on it everyday.
purchased the advantage lite table tennis table about two weeks ago, and have used it for about a week. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase. The delivery is on time, and the table is in pristine condition. Here are some detailed comments: Playability: the table is stable. Two pieces can be put together without any spare in between thanks to the independent casters. Quality: the ball bounces well. But the net is top long. Would be nice if the tension is adjustable. Aesthetics: the table looks beautiful. No complaint. Assembly: it's very easy to assemble just by myself. It took about 20 minutes.
Folds to the compact size.  Fits in the garage in front of the car when folded.  Easy setup.  Delivered without a scratch.  Lots of fun so far.
Good table, well built. It is large and heavy. Check on arrival for damage to the box as the table may have been damaged.
This is a nice heavy duty ping pong table.  I dont see how it would fold but that is not a problem for my house.  We are enjoying this table and would recommend.
We love this table! Easy to assemble and level, with a nice sturdy feel. Stores nicely in the garage and is easy to maneuver, since the wheels work and lock very well. I really like the 2 piece snap up feature. Our game has taken a step up with this table!
Professional table. Sturdy and well made. Worth the money.
Table arrived in great shape.  Assembly was easy - needed a little leveling, but there were adjustable screws on each leg to make it perfect.  I wasn't sure about the blue surface instead of green - but it is great.table for friendly play.  It is a heavy table which is nice - I thought for the price - it might not be the best quality - but it proved me wrong.  It folds up easily for single play (much like a card table with the folding brackets) and it moves apart easily to use it as 2 smaller tables for entertaining.
High quality table. Ive had a good run lately with buying things that are actually worth the money and this is one of them. Assembly took me about ten minutes and we were playing. The net attaches with heavy duty clips which make it super easy. No constant adjusting like in the old days. I havent needed to store it yet but the folding part works well.
This is not the same table you grew up with as a kid! Honestly...hands down this is the most solid table I've seen. Got it out of the box and setup within about 10-15 minutes. It is easy to see that the materials that went into this table our top notch quality. My kids are having a blast, enjoying their summer and my wife and I are now getting into competition nights at home. I'd recommend this table to anyone looking.
This table was easy to assemble in less than 30 minutes. Its heavy to youll need two people. Table is sturdy. Would purchase again. Consider where youre going to keep this table and plan for how youre going to get it there.  Folds up easy.
The table top provides a great solid surface and true bounce.  it is easy to fold and store.  The legs are strong and sturdy.  It makes a nice configuration to play by yourself, too.  The product was shipped in a damage proof cardboard and masonite container; it was easy to assemble the remaining parts (only a few leg components).  The instructions, both text and graphics, were outstanding and simple to follow.  The net has nice features to make it simple to install and make it taught.  The table looks nice with a blue top and white lines. Norm
We just bought the STIGA Advantage Table Tennis Indoor Table. it was very easy to assemble. We set it to play in the garage. It takes the place of one car. And we fold it to the side when we are done. My kids are very happy with this purchase. Thank you!
Great quality for a great price ! Easy to move and put away !
What a smooth assembly. I had previously assembled a different table that took hours, but this one took about 10 minutes (a total of 8 bolts and washers, then clamping on the posts for the net)! The quality of the materials is top notch, which I had expected from playing on a Stiga table previously. It is nice to have the wheels to make for easy storage when we're not using the table.
The instructions were easy to follow and all parts were there as indicated in the booklet.  My wife and I were able to put this together without issue.  Very solid and Saturday.  Would recommend to others.
Very easy to finish assembly, other than it is heavy.  Seems like a very sturdy table.  Haven't noticed any dead spots on the service.  Very happy with it so far.
Got the Advantage pro - bounce response is excellent, build is very good (frame, and quality big casters). Looks great in our basement. Assembly was easy, took 15 minutes for 2 people.
We were very satisfied with this product.  It came shipped well, very protected and in impeccable shape.  It was easy to assemble and ready for action in 1 hour.  It is very sturdy.  The net is strong and looks like it will hold up well.  I would make this purchase again!
This table is amazing!  Very easy to assemble (9 year old easy).  My son loves the look and feel.  Its competition ready and great for all skill levels.  I cant recommend it more.  Delivery was great as well.  Very kind gentleman put the box in our garage.
This is a great ping pong table! Opening, assembly, and setup were all done within an hour. It is very sturdy, and will last a long time.
Pro's It came very well packaged, not a dent or a scratch. Legs are already assembled and attached which makes it easy to set up. The only thing you have to do is insert the wheels which takes no more than 15 minutes A lot sturdier than other ping pong tables I have seen in that same price range Con's It comes in tow separate pieces that not attached to each other.  You just have to get used to moving two separate pieces around for storage A little disappointed on the top color they used.  It's light blue that would require you to use orange balls to have good enough contrast
Easy set up and good quality table. Larger than I expected but I did not read the dimensions. Lots of fun for the family and seems like it will last a long time.
We used this table one than a month, we really like it, easy to setup, very solid and high quality. Very good product.
well overall good enough at this moment. The delivermen from the contracted logistic firm did a really good job. Fortunately I found the tools to get it done. Ready to move it backwards from outside having concerns on its warping issue after too much exposure to the sunshine.
The assembly was very easy. The table components were packaged well, and much of the most complicated connections were already assembled. As one person, assembly took about 30-45 minutes. The table is a beautiful blue and looks very clean and sleek. Setup for play has been good so far. Some users of other tables might be surprised to find that the two halves of the table are completely separate, only held together by the clamps in the middle that support the net. Our biggest complaint is that one side of the table came warped in the middle. There is a slight bend upward that may have been a result of shipping and could affect play.
The product itself is of high quality. However mine had a few scratches and dings on the table. Also one of the medal pieces on the underside of the table on the end of the table was unscrewed and bent. I have to fix it, but there is still a small gap between the metal piece that is suppose to be screwed into the table. I am very disappointed that a $500 table had theses imperfections.
Decent table once set up. However dont lean it on a side with any rails, they will break easily. And a brace was bent out of the box. Pretty flimsy, doubt it will last a year.
I'm not ping pong pro, but the table seems to be very good. No damage on delivery. Easy setup.
I searched a few tables before purchasing this one and chose this table based on quality of reviews and price. Upon receipt of the table it had been slightly damaged in shipping but after working on it a bit not enough to cause any issues. Amazon actually was generous in the offer provided to correct the shipping issue. The table set up was relatively simple and I was able to take care of it with in about 30 minutes. The look and feel of the stable is sturdy and I would recommend anyone looking for a quality table at a reasonable price to consider this table.
Great product. Good price. Reasonable shipping time.
Bought it for my family for Christmas and everyone loves it!  It's a solid, attractive table and most of all, easy to assemble.  It was one of the reasons why we chose this table (STIGA Advantage) and it didn't disappoint.  Just needed an additional adult to lift it upright after my husband spent about 20 min. on it.  Mostly, kudos to Amazon for their fantastic return/exchange policy.  Although it came through a delivery service, 3 of the 4 inside corners were chipped and one outer corner cap had broken off.  Instead of having to deal with STIGA through their lengthy warranty policy, Amazon simply allowed me to return it and shipped another one immediately.  The second table still had chips in 2 of the interior corners (doesn't affect performance and is hidden under the net posts) but we didn't want to go through the pain of disassembling and returning a 200 lb. table, so we're keeping it. STIGA needs to do a better job of packaging the table for shipping.  Otherwise a great product!
The quality of the table is good and hope the board quality maintains.But very happy with the purchase so far as the assembly was super easy just as they mention 10mins , only thing noticed was that the latch lever felt little cheap but as long as it holds and sturdy it serves the purpose .But not sure why the product has 90 day warranty as compared to 1 year manufactured warranty so I would suggest ensure to read that and confirm as in the order it was not mentioned 90 day so I assumed it was 1 year as any other products from Amazon  .Will probably update my review in few weeks after the usage  as this being a big purchase.
The table arrive promptly on the scheduled day and the shipper (XPO) did a great job in bringing it thru my back entrance into my basement. The table was easy to assemble (took me ~30 mins with the help of my 2 kids), but I noticed that the metal on the braces/wheel legs part was bit bending inwards as I tightened the screws. I also noticed that my friends table from Joola (similar price range) had much thicker legs and metal parts didnt show any signs of bending inwards. I spent sometime trying to balance the table and I cant tell if its uneven basement floor or its the table because I could get the 2 tables to align perfectly in the middle, the clamps for the net helped in aligning the height. Unfortunately, the net also came snagged and I had to call the customer service, who were very nice and were happy to place a quick replacement order for me. I havent played much, so Ill update my review with that experience. So far I place it just below 4.5 stars.
Talk about super easy to put together and fast. The most difficult thing was getting it where I wanted it. I had the delivery people put it in my garage thinking my husband and I could take it from there. Well, we could but only after we opened it and carried each piece individually. I knew that it was heavy from previous reviews so that didnt bother me. So far, and its only been a few days, love the table. Its very nice for what we need it for.
We are very happy with this, works fine and easy to put away. We put it in storage position after every use, so ease of set up and storage was important. Much easier than I expected! I was nervous about getting the basic model, but quality is just fine for recreational use with the grandkids.
First table arrived in badly damaged box, one side entirely open. I accepted it hoping the table itself would not be damaged, but it was (table scratched / chipped and box with net completely ripped up) so I arranged for a pick-up and then ordered another table. Second table arrived in undamaged box, was fairly easy to put together. However, as others have noted, there are quality control issues with this table. One wheel on one leg did not turn (I had to loosen the nut) and two screws have fallen out to date (I super glued them back in as the hole is stripped). Overall, the table itself is great and should be 4.5 stars, but I expect better QC from the manufacturer, as well as a box that isn't a mess (the delivery guys blamed it on the "warehouse guys throwing stuff around").
The box may be bulky so I suggest you spend the extra $20.00 to get it placed in the room you want. Make sure you have a flat, smooth surface as the table has to be face down while assembling the wheels. It was easy to assemble with a 8mm ratchet. Need at least one other person to help unpack, assemble and flip the. table over when done. It has been great so far. We chose the blue color which is a pleasing change from the green ones we have had in the past.
When I opened the box, table had visible damage to the underside. Also had some paint on the side. Not sure if this table is brand new, might have been a return. Other then that, the table works perfectly fine.
We were a little concerned when the package arrived, it was pretty banged up and a few large holes in the side of the box by the shipper!  Fortunately, the table had plenty of padding protection and there wasn't any damage to the table itself.  We were amazed at how simple it was to put the table together (less than an hour) which made us very happy.  The table's appearance is sleek and the color is rich and beautiful.  My husband claims that the bounce of the ball could be better but he is comparing it to professional tables that he played on as a young man.  I recommend this table for it's value, durability and convenience.
there's only a 90 day limited warranty on this table so BUYER BEWARE. There is spider-vein cracking in several places and white chalky discoloration after 10 months of use - and we keep it covered when it's not in use! The price of this ping pong table tennis seemed good until it only lasted 10 months!
I got my son this table for his birthday and we have loved it.  It was shipped to our door and assembly took 10 minutes (Fastening 4 screws and bolts, clamping the net in place, and your set!)  It plays well, the quality is top notch, it looks good, and stores easily.  I would highly recommend this table.
I had heard horror stories about ping pong tables taking hours to assemble This was easy.  2 bolts on 4 legs and thats about it One thing to note - the actual box weighs A LOT. No way one person can move or lift.  However part of the weight is exceptionally strong protection of the table (kind of a particleboard)
Ordered via Prime, but took 4 days to arrive. Final delivery by XPO was disappointing as the man was not pleasant and did slight damage to my door threshold with his ragged dolly truck when entering my home. Table itself was in pretty good shape when unboxed, but one corner was missing some of the white line paint - not a huge deal, but frustrating on a brand new product. Assembly was super easy and fast. A second set of hands is definitely helpful though. Table looks great once set up and seems plenty sturdy. One nice improvement would be to integrate some sort of system to adjust for uneven floors.
Im glad my wife was not home, as the delivery personnel had their pants down to their knees and showed all their underwear - how do these people get away with this kind of behavior????
Excellent table !! Installation was easy and fast (about 20 min). Need 2 persons to flip halves of table couple of times, otherwise it is one-man job (just to attach legs). Very sturdy table and feels very solid. The net has excellent quality, very easy to install and the clips are strong - keeps table together very good ! Easy to move on the wheels, and easy to fold for one-player position. Nice blue color, and easy to see white balls on such background. I would like to have balls rack attached to the table (both side) - this is a feature this table does not have. Also, this table has a little slow ball rebound because of 5/8" top thickness, so this table is more for beginners (like most of my family). Overall, excellent table and I am happy with my purchase so far ! All my friends gave 5 stars for this table.
We are very happy with this table.  It got "Lost" by the delivery company during our Christmas time purchase. I had paid for the delivery to the room of my choice and then I was told it wasn't coming at all, which was a bummer for the Christmas surprise for my kids. Amazon sent me another after Christmas, they were great. It was delivered on my stoop while I was at work in the pouring rain. This box cannot be moved alone. I had to break open the box in the dark, in the rain and carry each piece inside. Luckily nothing got ruined. The product is great, though.
I bought this for my wife's birthday (yes, it was for her). It was so easy to assemble. It is also very quick to fold up and put away. I used to have the one-part table and it was a pain to store because it was so big. This table decomposes into two different tables that nestle together in a small space. The blue color is pleasing and the gameplay is fantastic. I highly recommend this table.
I preferred green, but it is not available from Stiga. To my surprise, the blue color of the Stiga table is very pleasant and just right for my eyes. The table looks smart. The manual included is for assembly only and doesn't tell me how to easily separate the two halves. Nor does it tell me how to flip one half up for a single player.
We have been playing on the table for a few months. It has been a great addition to the house and a lot of fun. The table it self was very easy to set up. It took two of us about 15 minutes. I helped my girlfriend set hers up and and it took us a few hours and was only $100 less and appears and feels inferior to this table. Highly recommend paying a little more fir this one. I havent tried folding it up to play solo, other than that the table has met or exceeded expectations.
I bought this table for family fun night.  I research many tables and decided to go with the stiga. I got a black Friday deal on this table for$207 versus the original$349. First of all,  this tables fit and finish is excellent.  The packaging is also high quality and the table was in perfect condition when delivered.  Assembly only  took 20 minutes.  It's truly 95%assembled.  I also assembled the table by myself which wasn't a problem at all.  Again the appearance is high actually and constructed extremely well.  I highly recommend this table.  Again im just a recreational player and getting my kids introduced as well so I know how important playability and appearance are for newbies.  I hope this review helps.  Im very impressed with this Stiga table!
The Stiga table looks good and solid, though we haven't played on it yet because we need help (we're in our 70s) to flip it over onto its legs. Delivery went better than expected.  Set up was not at all difficult, but one of the orange leg release latches was bent out of shape to the point of uselessness, so I don't think we will ever be able to fold up the table to store it flat.  On the other hand, we probably wouldn't do that anyway, so we'll let this problem slide.  We looked at the specs of many other tables, at many price points; this looked like the best bang for the buck.  We especially liked that the Stiga Advantage Competition is green rather than blue, and that it doesn't have a huge brand logo painted on the playing surface.
Received the table a few weeks ago and just set it up. The table was package very well, so even though the outside box appeared to have lots of wear and tear, the table itself was in great shape. With the caveat that I am not an expert in table tennis, this table looks to be of very high quality and was a great value! -The table folds well if you need to store it and is very compact when folded. -Maneuvers well even over carpet. -Love that you can play as single player with one half the table pivoted up at 90 degrees. -Surface is high quality. -Net just clamps on with strong clamps making setup and take down a breeze. -Table structure is rigid. -Directions are well written and figures are well drawn, and there's even a full explosion will all parts identified and labelled for future replacement if needed. -Easy to assemble, just need to bolt on the legs/castors - that's it! Note that the table does not include balls or paddles, so these need to be ordered separately.
After reading many reviews of various table tennis tables I decide on the STIGA Advantage.  It arrived on time and the packaging was in good condition.  All parts were included.  The instructions were clear and my daughter and I assembled it in about 15 minutes. It was very easy to assemble. We were playing on it within half an hour. We love this table!  It looks great, is good quality.  We have it set up in our garage.  It is actually two half tables which are connected only by the clamps of the net.  I was a little Leary about this but the two halfs butt up very well to each other and the locking wheels keep it steadily in place.  The net is super easy to attach to the table and remains taut during play. At the end of the evening it took less than 5 minutes to put the table in its upright storage position so we could move the car back into the garage. I have zero complaints about this table and would highly recommend it!
I got this on prime day for $100 off the regular price, unbeatable at $300. They ship it in a box that is reinforced with 1/8 inch particle board to protect it in shipping, which was much appreciated. Good value for the table thickness.  Fairly easy to assemble, you just have to put the bottom half of the legs on, took me about 15 mins once I had the tools together and figured out how it worked.  The table rolls very easily on concrete flooring.  It folds open and closed very easily as well. Very happy with my purchase
Bought this Table Tennis Table to get my kids away from their electronics and back to having some family fun time.  Soon after getting this table setup we were finally able to get our kids out of their rooms and playing. We had so much fun laughing and even my 14 year old son asked to keep playing.  Simple wonders. The quality is fantastic, and I could tell it was made with sturdy materials that will last over time and also looks nice.  I was surprised how easy it was to put together.  When it arrived, I was dreading putting together a complicated table; however, there were only a few parts to assemble and were easy to do.  I recommend this table to anyone who might be interested in learning table tennis or someone that already is familiar with the game.
Table arrived with significant damage to outer packaging.  Then I opened the box.  One leg brace had a large dent.  One leg literally had metal sheared from some sort of impact.  One of the little brackets that the casters are attached to was welded crooked so the caster is crooked.  13 sheet rock screws that attach braces to the table were stripped , they are falling out of the table.  The table top was in good shape.  I'm pretty disappointed to buy a 400 dollar table that was so cheaply built.  Under normal circumstances it would be a no brainer, I would return it.  Since it would be such a pain in the ass to return and the top survived the trip I'll probably keep it.  This particular table is not worth 400 dollars. Edit 1/16/19.  Contacted Escalade Sports.  To their credit they offered to send a replacement table.  I had the table set up in my basement, packaging was destroyed, and the table top itself was in good condition so I declined as it would be a pain to dis-assemble, get out of basement, repackage and so on.  They then offered to send some paddles.  I declined and sent pictures of the damaged parts asking if they could send me replacement parts.  I need a new leg, caster assembly and cross brace.  They said sure no problem, even sent me an update that the parts were on order.  Today I received a package from Escalade.  They sent me a net.  lol
As advertised, this table was 95% pre-assembled - the  remaining 5% was not a hassle at all. Just need 2 adults for less than 30 mins of assembly. The hardest part for me was moving the delivered package to basement. The quality of the table is nice and it looks amazing.  I can fold it easily and move it around in my basement or for storage . The playability is as good as you would see in local clubs or your office recreation area. I am really happy about this indoor sport investment.
Prior to purchasing I read reviews of comparable tables and also considered buying used on craigslist. There are lots of 'deals' on sites like craigslist. I've bought used in the past and taking the table apart for transport and reassembling for play I discovered puts a lot of wear and tear on the table. Taking that and other table reviews into account I still made this purchase and I'm glad I did. It's a bit of an investment for me - maybe four times what I could have paid for a used option - but this table has so far exceeded my expectations. I live in a small apartment and having the sides of the tables on separate legs is a huge 'advantage'. Wheels make it very easy to move. It's also very easy to set up for play and tuck back against the wall when not in use. I also really like the design. The net clamp is a simple and smart design. Maybe I haven't seen a new table in a while but this one seems pretty innovative and accessible for the home player. The delivery company also provided exceedingly great customer service. Rare. A couple things I don't love -the net was a bit stressed/stretched/torn upon arrival -even cheap paddles and balls would be nice to include with the table All in all a great table at a manageable price, esp when you take the quality, free scheduled delivery, and design into account.
This is our second ping pong table. This table is worth the extra money because it is very sturdy and folds in seconds. The wheels are easy move. Our original table was half the cost, but took about 10 minutes to fold away. The only hard part of assembly was the flipping the heavy table right-side up. I bought it because of the great ratings and now agree with those ratings as an owner.
After exhaustively looking for a good ping pong table, I was swayed towards this one because of the stellar reviews - and it doesn't disappoint. It comes in one large heavy box, and just like the description says, is practically assembled. It only took my son and I (better to have two people because the two halves are very heavy) about 15 minutes to attach the legs, and it was ready to play! When you are done playing and want to collapse the table, each separate half folds up and locks into place. Then just wheel each side towards each other and it's ready to store. The two half concept is also helpful if you want to roll one half up against a wall and practice by yourself. All in all, very happy with this purchase.
Great price performance ratio.  The bounce is off toward the edges.
Yaaaaaas! Ive wanted to buy a ping pong table for ages and Im so happy that I bought this one. Its sturdy And so easy to fold up. I literally have zero negatives to report. Stiga for the win.
I bought this table to put in my basement for occasional entertainment. I received on time and the delivery service was great: on time and very courteous. The table was very easy to assemble; it took about 15 minutes and I did it by myself. The table looks beautifull!!! It is also of superb quality!!! I enjoy it immensely; the bouncing of the ball is as good as it goes. And it is so easy to unfold and move it over to the side. In fact, I fold it and move it every time I want to play and it takes me 30 seconds. Overall, great product, especially for its price compared to more expensive tables.
We got this table to have as we have always wanted a nice Table Tennis table to use in the garage and driveway.  It is a nice quality table and very easy to move around and store.  Folds up easily and the side roll together to take up very little space.  I really like how the net breaks down with the clamps and stays taught during play.  Also, wheel locks are really good and keep the table very stable.  Overall, I have no complaints, except I thought it came with the paddles and a ball, but it did not, so don't forget to order a set when you order the table.
Got this table for our game room. Our kids are 13 and 10. WE LOVE IT! Some assembly required, took maybe 30-45 minutes to get set up from out of the box to ready to play. Definitely recommend having it delivered to the room of choice, especially if you want it upstairs - because IT IS HEAVY.  It's really sturdy. It's not going to topple or move around while playing! We're very happy with this table!
Amazing table for the price.  Were not professional but this looks like a professional table.  Splurge for the room of choice delivery . This table is super heavy in package.  Easy assembly and Easy to maneuver once you have it put together.  Folds away so nicely also!
It was a nice table but we had to return it because it was too large for the room. Amazon helped us swap it out real easy.
This table was extremely easy to put together. (Once I corrected a stupid mistake that cost me 3 minutes) because I didnt read the instructions, it only took me 10 minutes to be playing. I love the split table. Makes maneuvering a breeze. The table quality itself is outstanding. I love how the net clamps hold both tables together. Folded up and nested together, the footprint is very small in my garage. This table will provide my family many fun memories for years to come.
Just got this item and had 2 of the wheels already fall off and remove the welding to hold up the ping pong table. Better if it's just stationary, quality was pretty bad in terms of the legs and wheels.
Good quality table.  Assembled relatively easy.  Easy to follow instructions.  Very mobile.  Folds up and rolls around easy in two pieces.  Easy to install net.  The downside is the screws that hold the braces into the table are barely seated into the wood so they pop out.  Easily solved by buying slightly longer screws and re-drilling.  May not be necessary but I did it after 4 screws popped out in first month.  They need to fix that.
Great ping pong table It was easy to install I bought it as a gift for my married children, and my son was able to put it together by himself. I highly recommend this ping pong table
Crazy how I ordered this table late Tuesday night and it arrived that following Thursday before I even made it home from work! Delivery guy was a bit rough on the box, but this table was VERY WELL packaged and sustained NO damage, Thank God! I did not feel like going through the hassle of having to return the table and wait for a new one to arrive. Table looks GREAT, assembly was EASY, and my Fiance and I are having a BLAST with it so far! Thanks STIGA!!!
We bought this for our kids for Christmas. We have had fun playing against each other. It is easy to put together taking us maybe 20 minutes. Definitely need 2 people to hold and maneuver.  The table is sturdy and easy to store. I can move it by myself in the sturdy rollers.
Solid built table. Leveling screws.  Box had some marks but had wood supports and sides to protect during trucking. Net is very durable. Paddles and balls do not come with table.  Table is 2 halves for ease of moving and assembly.
I was looking for a nice ping pong table that the family could play in the basement and this table meets all the requirements of being sturdy built, very easy to put together by 1 person in 15-20 mins, and great quality for $400.  The only tool required is a socket wrench to screw on the folding bars to the table. The 5/8 inch thick table top is excellent and the ball bounces as expected on this quality of a table. It's very easy to fold and put away...the wheels move fine on carpet or hard surface. Highly recommend people who are looking for an entry level table, to seriously consider buying this table as it feels like i'm playing on a $1-2K table.
Initially I was debating if we needed such an expensive ping pong table, but Im glad we did. It was easy to assemble, so we were playing within 30 mins of delivery. Beautiful color and very sturdy.  Kids love it, adults love it... neighbors and friends stop by for a quick ping pong game all the time. One of the best entertainment purchases weve made in years.  Highly recommend!
Great ping pong table. First one came cracked, so had to wait 30 days for replacement. Worth the wait. Quite heavy!
We love it!! I had a ping pong table when I was younger and wanted to share the experience with my kids. I searched different places and brands. I didn't want to write a review immediately just in case it wasn't as easy to use and move like the video said. We have been enjoying for over a month now. It is everything the video said and more.  Put it together with one of my girls and it was done in no time. so easy to move from two player to one player that my 10 year old can do it.  The table is well built and sturdy. I know we will get many years of family fun with this table
We debated on what ping pong table to get for sometime. We wanted high quality and easy to fold and store. This has exceeded our expectations. Its a very stable table and easy enough for our 6 year old to fold and push aside for storage!  We are anxious to spend make many more family memories on the ping pong table.
I couldn't believe how easy the assembly was!  Literally 8 bolts and you're done.  It's great how the table folds up and easily wheels around.  Super playing surface.  The net couldn't be more easy to attach.  A+!
This stiga ping pong table is very solid, the ball bounces almost the same as the 1" wood surface on the official tournament tables. the quality of the materials are outstanding i have the table outside on my lanai and i cover it when not in use and still looks like new. the design is very appealing and the assembly was very easy you almost don't need instructions. I have had several ping pong tables, so far this is the best one and for the price you can't complaint
Review for Advantage Lite. Quality Stiga construction.  Its not the best Stiga table, but an excellent choice for your first family table. The only thing that caught me by surprise is that the table is in two separate pieces, that you can wheel around to store when youre done.  I was expecting it to be a table with both sides hinged together, where you moved the entire table around after you fold it up. Still a satisfied customer.
I was a little apprehensive in ordering a large Table Tennis table through the internet. But it really went smooth. I got to choose the date and 2 hour window for the delivery and then received reminders via e mail. The day of the delivery I received a phone call informing me exactly when they would arrive at my house. The packaging for the table was very protective. With card board on the outside and then a thin sheet of a very hard material glued to the cardboard that gave the package protection. The package of course was very heavy so I removed the table from the packaging and then carried half of the table down stairs.  The assembly took 15 to 20 minutes max and was very easy. Love the table and its performance. Overall this is a top notch table.
well you would think for $500 you would get a table that 1. has instructions .@. came with the right size bolts to put it properly together. i dont know if this was a return or brand new box was pretty taped , no instructions at all ok go online , but when your trying to bolt the brackets for the wheels and they are not long enough too go through the leg frames  hassle went too hardware store for new bolts
This table is heavy, durable, plays great, and looks "pro". One of the coolest things about this table is that it's two separate halves which easily and securely connect with the net clamps. Each half independently raises and lowers, so it has utility outside of just being a ping pong table. It is quite heavy, so make sure to have two adults to assemble the thing (or one mild-tempered, strong adult). This is definitely a quality table, worth the money. I've played on some cheaper, flimsier tables and this table is not one of those. No regrets; would buy again (not that we'd have to)!
We pored over reviews before buying this table. This is a terrific choice. It meets all our needs as a family with kids who want to play ping pong. The folding up and rolling on wheels allows us to store the table easily. My 10-year-old can take it out, set it up, and put it away himself. Highly recommend.
Item arrived on scheduled day and time slot. Although the item is very heavy it was very easy to assemble in the garage and then roll each half into our game room. The box arrived with some damage but the way item is boxed/packaged it survived the bumps without a scratch. We are very pleased with the quality of the build and the finish is very professional. Would definitely recommend this table to anyone who loves Ping Pong!
This was a fabulous purchase. The product arrived well-packed and only required a wrench to attach the casters. The net is good quality and I love the clamp mechanism for the net. Table is solid and the leveling feet made for easy adjustments. It will absolutely double as extra seating for large family gatherings. Collapsing and maneuverability is great too. My only wish would be that the coasters have been designed as quick-release in case we need to store it in a narrow area.
Unfortunately we didn't unbox our table until Christmas Eve, the box was clearly dropped and two table corners were badly damaged.  Submitted the exchange on Tuesday night and had a brand new table (along with taking the damaged table) by Friday.  Yes, it wasn't here on the big day, but the new table was perfect.  Easy to assemble, easy to set up and take down and such a nice table for the price. You will not find a better table for the price.
The table doesn't affect play quality compared to more expensive tables. It is just less convenient to put away (being in 2 parts). You need to unclip the net and fold each half of the table separately. Slamming hand into table does not create vibrations. I have set this up indoors on a hardwood floor. The rollers don't seem to damage hardwood. I had put felt sliders on the legs with adjustable plastic feet just in case. The circular feet contact the floor only on their circumference.
Very good quality fir the price. Easy to assemble and  also easy to move around.
It was a really fun table but when I separated them so my son could play with the wall like it said the one he wasnt using FOLDED BY ITSELF! He couldve got terribly hurt
I was initially a bit worried about the amount of assembly to expect, but on receiving the table we were up and running within 15 minutes.  Materials feel like quality.  Only had it for a couple of days, and it plays great.  Looking forward to see how it keeps over time.
really nice quality and easy to assemble.  this has some weight to it, but I had the Amazon delivery guys put this in the front room so I could unbox and assemble the wheels.  Once the wheels are on, this folds up really well and rolls easily through the house.
Great quality table. Very easy to fold & move out of way when not in use. My family is enjoying this! The only negative was the delivery guys were downright rude. NSA is who they were contacted by. If you have a choice, I wouldn't use them for delivery
The heavy box must have been very badly handled/dropped. There was only one/two external tears on the box but inside the table top had some crush damage and part of the frame was bent. The assembly was pretty simple and the structure seems solid. Such a pity it was transported with little care!
I never leave product reviews and we order a lot of products from Amazon.  I decided to leave a review for this table because I was so pleased with everything.  The table arrived promptly.  Assembly was simple and straight forward.  The table is looks very nice and is extremely durable.  My 8 and 9 year old boys have no trouble folding it and rolling it into our storage.  I'm so happy I bought this table and have recommended it to friends.
This STIGA Advantage table tennis table is of excellent quality with premium materials all around making it seem extremely professional. Another plus point is its wonderful and sleek look (in my opinion, the best-looking table tennis table in the market. Finally, it has a quick assembly time right out of the box with no issues.
This is a really good table.  I wouldn't know just how good it is if I hadn't helped a friend assemble theirs the week before mine arrived. Theirs came unassembled and it took us about 3 hours to put it together. When finished the quality was pretty poor. This table that I ordered came pre assembled and the quality is WAY better, even though the price was about the same. The brand was the same so just make sure you order this model and you won't be disappointed. I'm not a pro but this seems like a really good table, especially for the price. Should last a long time.
So far, so good! It was pretty easy to assemble...probably took 30 minutes max. Looks great and performs well, but its only been 2 months.
As i opened the first leg to assemble the leg and its screws pulled out of table. Then none of the bolts fit the table. So i was unable to assemble for Christmas. Thanks.
I purchased this ping pong table to practice playing ping pong with my two young sons. When it arrived, the delivery people were nice enough to drop it off in my garage. I managed to assemble the table without help from anyone, but it would have been much easier to flip the table halves over with someone else's help. The table was in perfect condition and feels very solid. Each half flips up into a vertical orientation for storage. The net installation is very quick with a clamp at either end. I got the Advantage version of the table and couldn't be happier. The table looks great and the balls bounce off it just as they should, the table surface is very even and smooth. Now the kids just need to practice more to compete against me.
I recently ordered this table tennis table as my kids always wanted to play that game. The price and the reviews on this product seemed to be very good to take a chance. So far it seems to be great, the assembly was quite simple, all parts included, nothing missing, for lifting after the assembly it requires 2 adults(as expected). The table looks great, I did not notice any injury on the surface or the other parts at first look. We played some test rounds with my wife and I am sure we will have lots of fun using this table. Folding the table is easy(for an adult) and the wheels makes it easy to move around.
extremely unhappy and disappointed, very cheaply made, loose screws which are suppose to hold plastic ends on side were loose in packaging does not feel like a $400 table at all, I would been better off buying some junk off of craigslist, very unhappy wish I could give negative stars..
This table was the easiest thing I have put together in years!!  Seriously and I'm a 65 yo woman.  All you have to do is attach the legs to the table.  You just need an extra pair of hands to stand the table up and that's it.  You are playing in less than 30 mins, if that!  The table is solid.  I highly recommend this table.
Each side of this table, the net clamps, and the net are all modular, which makes it really easy to take apart or move around.  The table is very sturdy with good rollers that can lock.  It conveniently shipped in a huge box to the top of my driveway--glad I didn't have to haul it from a store.
Great table that's easy to assemble. The delivery crew said other cheaper tables they deliver are routinely damaged in shipping but because this table only has two table pieces it often does much better in shipping. So long as this table isn't abused it should last a lifetime. I also like the net set up, very easy. It's also very compact so I can store it in a large closet I have.
We got this ping pong table mainly for our grandkids to play at our Christmas party.  It turned out being the hit of the night with everyone playing from grandpa (75) to Skylar (7).  We had tournaments and everyone had a great time. Grandpa and Nana assembled it in about one hour.  Very easy assembly (once we read the instructions :). It's a solid, sturdy table and we highly recommend it.  You will not be sorry.  Also, delivery was as promised - on time- and the delivery guys were friendly and nice.
I was going to buy a model that was $ 100 dollars cheaper...but all of the reviews mentioned how time consuming and tricky the assemblage was, and they had fewer stars for that reason..so I went for the bucks,  and the promise of easy assembly, and low and behold....twas a piece of cake. together in no time, easy, and it looks wonderful, plays just as nicely. And breaking it down for storage and then re assembling literally takes seconds/ I really like this table....now if I can just learn to play
Though read a few reviews stating cosmetic damage or slightly bent metal on their tables, mine had -0- issues. I'll admit the box was kind of a beast to handle, but well worth the effort.  All the parts were there, and instructions were easy to follow.  for that handyman, probably don't really even need the instructions.  Had it up and going in about 30 minutes.  Gotten lots of play on it already and very happy with this purchase. We are keeping it in the garage, so I am going to look for a dust cover.
Arrived damaged in the box. Quality is fair. Amazon does not have any way to address missing/damaged parts on large items. Returning a large item isnt feasible so you are stuck with it.
So happy we bought this. It arrived a few days late. Which was fine. Packaging was so well done, instructions to put it together were easy to follow, its incredibly easy to maneuver, my 9yr old switches from a full table to single player in an instant. Such a great buy, we have been using it constantly!!
Easy to move and stable enough for our family. Wish the wheels were a little beefier. One side dips a little but this is an easy fix with a furniture leveler.  Looks beautiful and hope it holds up. Pleased with product.
This table is worth the money! Showed up right when they said they would. Very sturdy very durable. Very easy to assemble. My husband loves it. Glad I went with this.
Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I bought this one over the Joola indoor table, because of a review that claimed it had a tougher build and better wheels. This table delivers the goods. It was very well packaged and transported with care, arriving at my home on time and without damage. It took me about 30 minutes to set up the table and level it. It is very well made and easy to install. It can also be used as a work bench, crafting table, or an extra pair of tables for entertaining. I love how it breaks apart in two pieces.  Well worth the price. See video to get an idea of how to assemble.
One of the main draws for purchasing this table was its ease of assembly promise.  Other than needing an additional pair of hands to flip the two table sections right side up after assembling the wheel brackets, this is a one person assembly operation.  The table is very sturdy and provides a good bounce.  I highly recommend the STIGA Advantage Competition-Ready Indoor Tennis Table.
We couldnt be happier with our new STIGA ping pong table! For starters, it was so easy to assemble. It was virtually assembled right out of the box and only needed a few minor steps to completion. My family has been really enjoying it ever since. My son even enjoys practicing his hitting by setting up the table in one player mode (which is very easy to do). It is also extrembly easy to fold up the table so you can move it to the side of the room if extra space is needed for another activity. Buy this table, you wont be sorry!
Great table. Was very easy to assemble because it comes partly preassembled. Did need two wrenches and my sons help. But doesnt take long at all. Havent moved it around or folded yet but imagining that it wouldnt be super hard.
We've had this table for over a month now, and love it. It was so simple to assemble - just attach the legs/casters, and that's it. I only needed a little help to pick it up and set it on it's legs...that requires 2 people.  I've had to fold it up to make room for a party (used one half of the table for the party, actually - which was handy), and it's very easy to do. It fits nicely in a back closet for storage. We use the table almost every day, and have really enjoyed it. No complaints so far.
Sometimes you get more than you pay for - that's the case with the Stiga Advantage.  This looks and plays like a higher-end table than it really is.  Delivery was smooth, the packaging did a great job protecting the table, and assembly was easy (15 minutes by myself).  I purchased paddles & balls separately and was ready to go.  The light blue color even goes well with our game room.  Folding & unfolding is a one-person job.  Great table all the way around.
Excellent table for my 10yr old and me to practice on at home (son's coach asked us to get one for home practice). The package is heavy and needs 2 people to move around, but assembly was super easy. Needs 2 wrenches and about 30-60 mins to put together. 80% of it was pre-assembled. Once assembled easy to move around using the wheels. Currently using inside the house and not sure if we can put it out in the patio during winter. Table itself came in good shape with no damages. Worth the price for sure.
[Edited Review] Have completed the installation and paddled the ball back and forth a couple of time with my wife.  The installation was easy.  To protect our wood floor, I bought some carpet-bottomed casters to go under the legs.  Probably not terribly smart in as much it will allow the table to slide if bumped by players, but oh well.  It's a nice looking table.  The net installs easily and is snug across the center (not sagging).  The balls seem to bounce OK, but I'll need some more time with that aspect of review.  Am satisfied so far. [From Original Review] I went around the underside and gently tightened the Philips-head screws that connect the frame to the underside of the playing surface.  On one table, 7 screws were stripped, and on the other, 3.  Probably no big thing.  I have been pondering how to deal with those loose screws before I set the table upright.  I thought about buying some very liquid filler material and letting it drip down through the opening of the removed screw, letting it set, and then screw in the 10 screws again.  Any thoughts?  I don't think a longer screw is advisable as it would poke through to the playing side of the table, right?  Not sure a fatter screw would fit.  On another note, I thought it may not be advisable to tighten the other bolts (other than the wheel assemblies) much, since they have to pivot when storing the table, right?
The assembly for this product literally takes minutes, so that's a plus. I love the way the two pieces nest beside each other. That sure saves space. The table is well made with quality materials. If your floor is slightly unlevel, there are instructions on how to level the table to made the center meet. I'm happy with this purchase, and my grandkids will be even happier.
I'm very happy with this table.  It was packaged securely, with all corners especially well-protected.  Assembly was very quick and easy; only eight bolts to attach.  The trickiest part is just moving around and flipping over the heavy table halves -- two people are recommended to avoid gouging any edges or corners. The top paint is flawless, as is all of the powder-coated metal.  This was a bit more expensive than the equivalent Joola model, but I liked the larger 4" wheels on this one.
I have had the STIGA Advantage Table Tennis Table for over a year now and it is absolutely incredible! It is a great quality table that is incredibly easy to assemble. Additionally, it looks great! It looks like a professional table tennis table for a great price! As it is foldable, it is easily one of the most portable, full-size table tennis tables that I have ever seen! Its 72-inch Tournament Grade Net and Post Set plus its Safety Latch System, make the playability and durability top-notch. Pros: Durability: It has a Safety Latch System and a 3/4 inch tabletop along with a tournament-grade net. Price: It is an amazing table for just $400.00. Assembly: It is absolutely trivial to assemble this table. For two people, it takes around 10 minutes to assemble out of the box. Quality: It is not a professional table, however, it is not a cheap table. It is a good quality table for a great price. Storage: It is a two-piece table to it folds, therefore, taking up minimal space. It is also very portable because of its wheels. Cons: The color is easily chipped and if you store the table somewhere slightly dusty, the color is not good at hiding the dirt and dust. It is easily movable so if you accidentally bump into the table, it moves a lot with minimal resistance. Overall, its playability, quality, aesthetics, and assembly are at professional levels for the price. I would recommend this table to anyone who wants to play recreationally or even wants to play professionally on an entry-level.
Im 63 years old and I put the table together myself with 2 wrenches and excellent instructions and pictures from Stiga. It took about 1.5 hours including reading the instructions first and taking a break between the two sides. My neighbor helped me turn both sides upright. You Definitely need 2-3 people to turn the two tables upright. Im having a blast playing ping pong for exercise with friends as well as alone with one side of the table folded up. Im really glad I invested in this great quality ping pong table!! Play Ping pong 
Love this product. Took wife and I about an hour to assemble bec we are brain-dead when assembling products but it may take you less time. I have to tell that this is a premium-quality product and with the wheels, it is so easy to move move this tennis table to another room if necessary.
Very happy with the table, setup and delivery. Table: The table seems to be very high quality.  All the components are good quality and heavy duty.  This table doesn't feel cheap and I expect it will stand up to the abuse of time. Setup: Setting up the table was a snap.  It really does only take 10-15 minutes.  You just attach the wheels and flip it over, clip the net and you are done.  The only complaint is that I couldn't figure out how to tighten the net.  I watched a few youtube videos of tables and was able to figure it out, but there could be more direction given about how to hold the net tight using the string and metal clip that comes attached to it. Delivery: The delivery was fine.  The 2 gentlemen that delivered it though were hardly able to lift the table so I offered to help them to avoid any damage.  There was no damage to the table and it is packaged really really well.  They know how to package this up and ship it that is for sure. We love the table and look forward to loads of use.
I received the delivery as scheduled today. I specified the particular date and time range. One delivery guy called ahead of time to confirm. It arrived on time. The delivery guys were very friendly and left the package where I wanted. I was so excited to open it. It was super heavy for a small Asian woman to handle it. But I did it all by myself! It was well packed with hardboard covers. The setup was easy. The instruction in the manual is very clear and easy to follow. The table looks very sturdy. I cannot wait to have my college daughter back home and play with me! So far I havent seen anything I dont like. It would be a great family Xmas gift for everyone! I am very happy!
My family and I could not be happier with our STIGA Advantage table purchase.  This is our first table tennis purchase and the table is better than the reviews I read before purchasing.  Quality is outstanding, and assembly was easy thanks to the great instructions.  My 16 year-old son and I put the table together and were playing is less than 30 minutes.  Separating the two table sides and moving them to the wall in our garage is also very easy thanks to how solid the table is built. I also have to give a shout out to the logistics company that delivered the table.  They called, asked if I wanted an earlier delivery, which we did, and they were on time, efficient and very professional.  Thanks STIGA and Amazon!
Nice ping pong table.  Easy set up. 95 percent comes set up folds legs a d clamp table together.  Real easy set up
I bought this table for family entertainment. The assembly is pretty simple because of its good design. most of the leg supporting parts are already installed, only the wheel leg extension need to be installed. if hey were pre-installed, the package would be too big for transportation. The table has been manufactured to a good standard. The blue surface and white lines are painted even and appealing. But you still need to educate your kids to try to avoid the contact between racket and the table surface. It could scratch the paint if the contact is strong. Overall, I am satisfied for my purchase. it is a good deal for the price at this range.
The table looks great, was easy to assemble, break down, and store, but it's not as durable as I had hoped it would be.  I use the table for my students' Table Tennis Club, and the kids play in my classroom, so every day they have to unfold and fold the table and roll it out of the way.  A few weeks after regular use, the screws started to fall out of the composite board.  I've talked to a co-worker who is going to help me retrofit the table, so the screws don't come out.  This table seems to be better suited for home use, rather than this kind of recreational use.
After months of researching, this is the ping pong table I decided to purchase. Durability, ease of storing, and price were all super important to me. This product seems super sturdy.  We love how it folds up so easily when not being used, and rolls to where we need it to be! It has already provided hours of entertainment. I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends.
This table was purchased as a Christmas present for my 13 year old son.  Shipping process was easy and convenient. Product arrived in perfect condition. The table took less then ten minutes to assemble.  Im very impressed with the quality and how easy it is to move.  We have spent hours playing and highly recommend purchasing this table over other brands.
After reading numerous reviews about numerous tables, we are very pleased with our decision to go with this one. Assembly was straightforward with good instructions and very little required. The table is sturdy and good quality. It is a pleasure to play on and to look atwe are thrilled!
Very nice and solid table. High quality top and frame, easy to fold and roll away when not is use.  Assembly was very easy, just remember to have another person to help you flip it once you are done attaching the legs. Net is of good quality with sold stands that help you keep both table pieces togather.
Playability - It is pretty good. I use this table to teach my daughter to play pingpong. I am going to buy a pingpong robot later. Quality - The quality is good, although you cannot compare the quality of this with a professional table( much more expensive ). I just use it two days. So far so good. Aesthetics - Actually, I don't care this. I just need one table that I can play pingpong. So I think it is okay. Assembly - The 4 legs have been installed on the two tables. You just need to install another 4 legs with wheels. You need another people to help you. It took me 20 ~ 30 minutes to complete the whole stuff.
Love this table!  It came very well packaged so there was little chance of in-transit damage. It was a very quick and easy assembly process. The table is well constructed and sturdy and it folds and stores very easily without much space required. The only problem so far is that the corner protectors seem loose and one has already fallen off. But no damage yet.
We are thrilled with this purchase.  We paid for the "expert assembly" and it was well worth it.  Two men came in, carried the heavy box to our basement and set up the table in less than 30 minutes; the men were friendly, professional and kind.  We have been playing ping-pong non-stop since getting the table.  My 10 year old son's friends come over to play, my 16 year old son plays with his friends, siblings and cousins and it was a big hit at our extended-family holiday party.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone who wants to have active fun with family and friends!
Great table! Had it for a couple of months now and is holding up well. The table came with a free assembly package so we took advantage of it, but it only took him 10 minutes to assemble. Literally, put the wheels on and he was done.  Takes 2-3 minutes to set up or take down for storage. Two separate sections so the nest against the wall to take up very little room.  Would highly recommend this table!
This is an awesome table for what it costs! Assembly is quick and easy. The quick-release net is great. Bounces true. Easy to move. Good quality for a basement, casual play table. Amazon shipping made it easy to get in the house. Just double check the table when you get it. Ours had a broken corner protection piece. Amazon helped and we emailed the manufacturer to get a replacement but be sure your table arrives in pristine condition. Were glad we bought this table and are really happy with the quality of this table and how it fits in our basement!
I would have given this 5 stars, but there were 3 broken bolts in the pre-assembled table that are impossible to replace as only the head is missing, and the thread part is still inside. This is most likely due to poor handling during shipping and low bolt quality. Other than this, I am happy with this table.
Beautiful looking table, great price, masterfully packaged and easy to assemble.  My only complaint is that the screws holding the folding arm are too small and too clustered together, and the table-top is composed of paper-like board.  I already threw away the packing materials so it would be too complicated to return.  I'll pour wood glue over the damaged area and get wider screws to repair it.
As has been mentioned frequently, the assembly process was extremely simple. While it would have been easier to assemble with two people, it is possible to assemble by yourself as I did (although it required very heavy lifting to move the table halves). All told it went from box to playable in 30-45 minutes. As far as the quality of the table itself, you definitely get what you pay for in the sense that this is not a professional grade product, nor should one expect it to be. I have played on very nice tables before, but these easily cost 3-5x more and would not have the convenience and easy storage components to it. One of the nicest features of the table is in fact how it splits into two halves for more compact storage (as well as for quick and easy solo play). We needed this option in order to be able to tuck away the table in our storage room when needed. I would recommend this table.
The table is great, easy to assemble and put away. The only issue was that it had a big dent on the metal frame. As seen in the picture, it looks like it took a strong hit to make the dent. The box was not damaged so this must have happened at the factory. Originally thought the table was not damaged, but its actually bent as can be seen in the second picture. Considering a replacement, Im afraid...
The box came beat up so we were a bit worried at first.  When we opened the box the table was in perfect condition, packed extremely well.  The only thing we had to do to put it together was add some wheels and we were off playing ping pong in no time.  The table levels easily and is easy to figure out how it folds and moves around.  The net and table were great quality. Thank you for a great product that we hope to enjoy using often!
I was looking for a ping pong table for family/recreational fun. I went ahead with Stiga after reading the positive reviews on Amazon and other website. Now having received and used the table, I can say the positive reviews are well deserved. This is a beautiful table. Love the blue color.  It has a very sturdy build. Assembly could not have been easier as it essentially arrives pre-assembled other than the wheeled legs. No problems with delivery - it was timely and without any damage. Very happy with this purchase.
This table was super easy to assemble.  You could do it alone, but it's a bit easier with a 2nd person.  One of the weld beads on the table leg was too long and wouldn't allow the bracket to slip over it, and this required a quick trip to the hardware store for a $15 metal file.  The filing took less than a minute, and then it was super easy to complete.  Total set-up (without the trip to the hardware store) was 20 minutes. The table itself has a great feel, and the option to fold up and nest against the wall is perfect.  This is also very easy to complete.  I would have given five stars, except for the welding bead that needed the file, so one star removed.
If 4.5 were an option, I'd give it that, but I opted for a 5/5 because it really is a very nice table for the price. I loved that it was mostly put together. I completed the set up myself in about 45 minutes - mostly because of getting it out of the packaging (which is understandably quite cumbersome!). It arrive in great shape; a few very minor scuff marks on the playing surface (which I think is to be expected). It's very solid, easy to fold up-down, and move around. Very nice net. We've had it about two weeks and we're really enjoying it!
Well packed which minimized damage during shipping. Easy to assemble but need 2 people given the weight.  Look up YouTube videos for tips on assembly.  The table is solidly constructed and folds easily. The net (included) is also of high quality. Overall we are satisfied with this purchase
This has been an excellent purchase!  Given these challenging times of staying at home, we all needed a fun pick me up.  We have enjoyed endless afternoons and evenings of ping pong.  The table was delivered very quickly and communication with the delivery service was amazing.  The table was placed in our garage on a pallet, which was fine because that is where we are keeping it.  My husband and I had the table unpacked, assembled, and set up in about 30 minutes.  A socket wrench made for quick assembly.  The table can be folded up and unfolded for use by a single individual.  It takes up very little space when folded up which is great!  We are extremely happy with this purchase and highly recommend this table!
I got this for my three boys for Christmas.  I was concerned that after it arrived I wouldn't be able to assemble it in time for Christmas, but it was easy to assemble in 2 or 3 hours.  I followed the instructions, but there were not too many parts and it was pretty intuitive, so I probably didn't really need them.  My only concern was the way the net clamps to the table, and it seems the clamps are the only thing holding the two halves together during play.  I was concerned it would jostle around and come apart a lot, but actually it seems pretty stable, and the boys have played on it for hours and hours without any problems.  Also, the way the net clamps to the table it only takes a few seconds to set it up, and the net stays in place and doesn't droop in the middle.  If you want a quality table at a reasonable price, this is it.
We love playing ping pong, but we are not sure if it is a good idea to have a ping pong table at home. Finally, we think it is time to give it a try, and, with some online research, we decide to get a table from STIGA. The table arrived well packaged (the box itself is really heavy because of lots of protection material used). It took me around 20 minutes to set it up all by my self. I think if the whole thing is lighter, I can definitely finish assembling it in 10 minutes. My son loves it, and we all have a good time playing ping pong at home. So far, we think it is the best purchase we made in 2019.
(review motivated by the free balls offer, but content not influenced) Delivery: Scheduled delivery, they called and delivered it an hour late, so perfectly acceptable. Setup: Easy setup, only 8 screws to be tightened. Moving the box into the garage was the hardest part of setup. Folding the table or opening it up takes less than 5 minutes. Attaching and tightening the net is very easy. Table: Happy with the color, the bounce of the balls on the table, the quality of the new and everything else. I thought I'd need a connector to keep the two half-tables attached to each other, but it has not been a problem. The table does not move that easily with the wheels locked. Good new year purchase, very happy with our choice.
I am NOT a paid or compensated reviewer.  I paid full price for this item, and am extremely pleased with it.  The table arrived VERY well packaged and protected.  Two pleasant, competent delivery people took it off the truck and walked it right into my garage at the scheduled delivery time.  Unpackaging and moving it down to the basement was manageable with the help of my teenage son (not sure I could have brought it downstairs by myself...you will likely need help to move the table pieces.)  We had it assembled within 15 minutes and have been playing almost every night since we got it.  I've played on high-end tables before, and this STIGA table is an excellent mid-level table for the home.  The table looks great, all components were present and in good shape after the delivery.  I have not noticed any issues at all, no dents, scratches, perfect corners...not even a loose screw!  Given the seemingly very good quality of the table, I expect to enjoy it for years to come!  Highly recommended!  Thanks STIGA and Amazon!
I bought this table for a second home and have just recently had an opportunity to play on it. I am very please with the table; the table top and net give great true play. The support structure is solid and sturdy as I had hoped it would be. I'm considering getting the same table for our regular home. I had to schedule delivery, but then the table arrived several days in advance, which was great because we are relatively remote and getting a pair of socks on Amazon can take ten days.
The first table they sent was broken en route and didn't make it to us at all.  Freight carrier sent it back.  Re ordered and got it last week.  Box was very heavy, had required two of us to just push it into garage before it started raining.  Refund for first one was prompt.  Easy to assemble, did require two folks to flip it over but mostly it was a one person job, more like 1 hour than 10 minutes.  Have it set up in garage as it's still rainy but plan to put it outside when rains stop.  I suspect, since it is an inside table, will have to fold up and cover at night.  It plays very well and having it in two sections makes it easier to move around.  It can be used by one person, with one side folded upright, but it takes some getting used to how quickly the ball returns to you.  Note that the table does not come with paddles and balls so you have to order these separately.  It is nice to have and fun to play.
Bought this table a year ago, and it's been a great choice. Excellent bounce, looks great and professional. Quality is unmatchable for the price point. Delivery was on time. Luckily, I set it up in our garage with the help of my dad, so wasn't difficult. But if you plan to place it in your basement, you will need help! The color is perfect and I've had many great games on it already. It folds pretty compact and takes less than 2 feet when folded in our 3 car garage. Has stood the test of weather thus far as I'm quite inconsistent with placing a cover on it. All in all, I think it's a great value and fit for an intermediate level player.
This is a top-quality table tennis/ping-pong table. Has already created hours of sweat and giggles. Fun for everyone. It is a SOLID table, meaning it's heavy for set up - requires two people. That being said, it was not at all difficult. Once it's set up, fold up and put away is super simple. (let's be honest, it never gets put away, though!) And though not top on my list, this is a beautifully crafted table! I never thought I'd describe a game table as such, but the white lines are apparent and seamless against the blue tabletop - I doubt we'll have any trouble with them separating from the table, etc. Same goes for the net - well strung, bright white top line against the blue tabletop. All in all, I highly recommend this table.
I was Leary of the 90% assembled.  But it was and the rest assembly was easy.  Top of the line quality.
Just ordered this table about a week ago. Had a lot of fun playing with it. The table looks great and the net and overall table is easily put together since it came in almost completely set up before hand. The only issue I had is when installing the legs with wheels, since it appears to be very very loose. However, once you stand the table up there were no issue whatsoever. Great table and highly recommend for beginners or casual players that do not have the tools to set up full tables.
This table was easy to assemble, it took my husband maybe an hour at most. It's also very sturdy which I appreciate because I have all boys. They have already enjoyed many hours of ping pong fun. I would recommend this product anyone looking for a high quality table.
Delivered within 5 days of order. Weighd 288 poubds and very well constructed. Preassembled and only about 20 mins to attach casters. Very impressed with the quality and industrial grade materials.
This is a very nicely made table. Very sturdy and heavy. The quality is great and plays very well. It looks very nice too. The assembly is simple. It very easy to fold and unfold. However, this table is VERY HEAVY. You should definitely pay to get it delivered to the room of choice.
Great table in this price range.  Came well well-packaged and well-protected.  It is heavy but assembly was straight-forward and simple with two people.  Once you set it up where you want, it stays in place even on carpet.  Folds up easily and the halves fit together nicely to take up minimum space when not in use.  You can also fold up half and practice.  The bounce is true and it's a solid table.  We play almost every day and love it!
Original table was damaged in shipment so delivery was late.  It happens!  But the late delivery was handled very well. Promptly and politely, following all directions.  Thanks.  We are happy with the table.  The quality is excellent and assembly was a snap.  I would make this purchase again.
After giving away my old table tennis table away, I have been searching for a new one to keep my family in shape. Searching through multiple web sites, I decided to purchase the Stiga Advanatge Table for its simplicity in assembly and not too pricey for my budget. After receiving the product, I am very happy to find out that everything is as good as advertised if not better.  Assembly is very easy and the table is very sturdy and perfect size for my basement.  It is also very easy to put it away when you need the space to do something else.  My wife is very happy that I purchased the table and I think it is a great investment that will keep my family healthy for a long time..
Bought this for our grandson, and he and his whole family really are enjoying it.  It looks great, moves around easily when needed to, and is a quality item.
Packaged very well to protect table. Assembly was pretty easy and quick. Play surface provides consistent bounce. We've really enjoyed the table over the first two weeks of ownership. I'll report back if I encounter any issues later on.
I have been trying to teach my son Table Tennis for last one year, We have been going through training but not having enough practice to improve our game and therefore finally we decided to put up the table in our garage. It took me very long time to decide which brand and table should I buy. I had these concerns in my mind - 1. Cost of the table. 2. Board thickness, which decides the bounce of the ball. 3. Fold-able/single player use. 4. Setting it up/Installation Out of these 4 I see that the only issue with this table is that it is 5/8" thick board and bounce of the ball is a little less than the 1" thick board that we use in the club. This is still a worth, this is just a minor difference for beginners, the cost of the 1" Butterfly table in the club is 1800-2200$ and this is just a 400$ table. If you are an advance player you may find a difference in the bounce of the ball, if you just want to practice and exercise dont even consider this point. Other than this everything else is a 5/5. Cost of the table is best compared to other tables with this price range. I would say this one has a much better bounce then others in this range. Easy to fold and takes around 3-4 feet of space when folded. Easy to setup again to play, takes 2-3 minutes to setup the net and match the 2 halves. The installation was also particularly easy, Amazon delivered it right inside my garage and then it took me 30 minutes to understand the instructions and 20 minutes to set it up. You need another person when you have invert the table.
TL;DR: If you want a good mid-grade table for home use this is a good decision. Just got done setting up this table after the scheduled delivery (which is such a good idea for large items like this!) and I must admit I am impressed. Pros: - Price: It is a "medium level" table for sure but the construction quality is nice and it's $400 which is not that much. - Install: As other reviewers have stated it's 8 bolts which is insanely easy to other Ping Pong table installations I have done in the past. - Quality: It is a MID-GRADE TABLE! Do not expect professional status anything! But, this table is well built and bounces like it should. Again, this is not a professional set up but for home/rec use it is totally reasonable and what you would expect (if not better than) for the price. - Two piece design: I have never owned a 2 piece table and am now realizing I am quite dumb for not buying one of these sooner because it takes up significantly less space than a convention fold up and is way easier to move when folded. - Net clips: This, again, is me just always buying low grade tables in the past but these net clips are freaking sweet as they not only level the middle of the table perfectly on both sides but take about 3 seconds to install each side making assemble and breakdown hilariously quick and easy. - One person assembly: I put the table together by myself in about 15 minutes. I wouldn't recommend a smaller/not strong person to attempt a single person assembly but if you can pick up each side of the table by yourself fairly easily you will be fine. - Packaging was great and despite damage to the box my table did not suffer any major damage. Cons: - The net came with a big rip in it (see pics) and is of lesser quality than other pieces included with table. - Getting a ping pong table shipped will probably always result in a tiny bit of damage at the least. I got lucky and only have a few small knicks on the bottom side of the table and a slightly ripped net but others seem to have chipped tops, etc. I did want to add a bit of info for those of you considering this table: - If you want a table for your home, don't want to go buy it in person (because you are lazy or don't have a car big enough), and have ~$400 to spend I really think this is a great table for the money. - I have owned a few tables over the years but always in the $200-$300 range and this is a HUGE step up from those in all respects. - I would suggest putting the two braces and one bolt through the wheel side of the bottom bracket assembly when putting them on. It makes the whole situation much easier (see pics for explanation). - I would also suggest to be vigilant and NOT OVER TIGHTEN the bolts. Once your washer starts to deform you are good to go and anything further will lose you sturdiness.
Novice player, wanted a table for kids to enjoy and get off their device screens and for family.  Bought the table with 20% off due to Amazon's Prime Day special sale.  Chose Stiga over Joola and others due to Stiga having less complaints on customer service than others. Elected to have the delivery to 1st room inside so no extra charges there, free delivery.  Two men delivered and handled the box with care.  Did a great job getting it into my basement.  I politely asked if they can move it into next room and they were kind enough to do so.  YMMV for others but mine was a straight shot from one to another. The box was in excellent condition.  Once opened, I see the two halves with the playing surface are facing each other, this helps reduce damage.  Any damage would only result in the underside surface and/or the corners.  Assembling is a piece of cake.  Literally assembles in 15 to 20 minutes.  All the screwed in parts from factory are perfect, didn't see any loose screws, crooked assembly, etc. Locking clip for the folded up halves, perfect fit, locks and unlocks without any rubbing.  The adjustable leg bottoms also spin freely, no issues there.  Two little issues that I did have with the table was the surface.  There is a small 1/8" dent near the side by the where the net goes (closer to center) on surface and also finger prints on surface.  The dent clearly happened during production, as there are no "fresh" damage like exposed material.  It's coated in same paint as the rest of of table surface.  It would have been nice if QA caught it early and filled it in prior to painting.  It no way affects play because it is close to the net but still unsightly and frustrating because it is a new purchase.  The finger prints appear to be there during the production as well, I can't wash it off or clean in any way.  Looks like it was there, after the paint but and then coated over with final protective coat? Not going to do an exchange because it's a bit of a pain and like I said above, due to where the dent is and a few prints, I think can live with it.  If there were more damage that affects play, I'd definitely go and request a new table. In hindsight, I think I may have chosen the thicker 3/4" Stiga table.  This is ok for family play and will do the job for us for the time being.  I went cheaper because I was not sure how younger kids will treat the table and didn't want to spend more only to have it damaged.  If I were buying, didn't have kids around, and have more experience, definitely thicker surface. Giving Stiga table 3 stars, due to the disappointing flaws.  If it came perfect, I'd give it 4 stars. FYI, Stiga offers free dozen 3 star balls for reviews.  I'll update the review to let others know if they back it up. UPDATE 8/17/19: I received the dozen 3 star balls from Stiga.  I emailed Stiga, I received a reply back shortly regarding the balls being sent out.  The balls then came pretty quick, maybe within 10 days of me contacting them.  Thumbs up for Stiga being prompt on connecting with their customers.
The hinges on this shoddily made table bent beyond fixing upon falling over the very first time out of the box. And don't expect any support from STIGA-it has now been 50 days worth of empty promises waiting on more wimpy hinges that won't support the weight of this startlingly heavy table, and they have delivered NADA but words of I'll get right on it. UPDATE: It took three months to get a replacement hinge from these irresponsible slapdash bums. And the hinge does not work. Please, do yourself a favor and buy a table from anyone other than these no conscience thieves. How do u justify making hinges that can't support the weight? Ugh. Warning: this table is super heavy. If u want one that u might need to move around by hand, or u need to break this down by yourself, this is not the table for u. It is over 200 lbs!
Not a good experience so far. I usually dont write but after lot of research and reading the reviews of many table tennis tables, I purchased Stiga Advantage for my Sons birthday gift. While assembling the table, I realized that one of the tables leg has wrong holes. One side of the table also had paint spots/bubbles in the middle. I called Amazon for help and finally after 45 minuets on the call, I have been scheduled to get a replacement and pick up the existing one. Very disappointing for my son. I hope to get a good replacement.
Great table. My wife and I are ping pong amateurs for sure. We play on vacation, at friends' houses, and whenever we get a chance. This is an awesome table and way nicer than we anticipated. It looks great and is really solid and heavy. Delivery was great and the guys brought it to our basement as only my wife was home when they came. I put the table together by myself in about 10 mins. As the table is essentially two tables, that conjoin at the net, you will need a second person to help lift a table and turn them over once the wheels are connected (if you don't have a second person to help, you probably shouldn't buy a ping pong table :-) ). The process overall was super simple. You'll need a couple pliers or wrenches to tighten the bolts but that's about it. It can store away really easy as you can put the tables at 90 degrees and roll them away. We haven't stored them as we've been busy enjoying them, but I tested it out and it was very simple to do. We play a bunch now and are really loving it. Great table, high quality and great quality for the price!
This is a GREAT table once it is assembled! I can't emphasize enough to have some one help you....especially if you are placing the table in a basement. It is HEAVY. I paid extra to have it delived to the basement and am glad I did! When attaching the legs....each leg comes in 2 parts with a splice in the middle of the leg and the splice is held by bolts. Your initial thought will be that the legs telescope into each other. They do NOT!. They sit on top of each other via this splice. You will need an extra set of hands to hold the upper and lower legs together while you attach the splice.  Unless you have a VERY strong grip!  At  72 I do not!  After attaching the legs, the remainder of the installation was very easy and straighforward and fast. Having a second person to turn the table over and upright is a MUST, also!  The grip on the net is hard to open BUT part of that reason is to help hold the table together as it comes in only two major pieces. The wheels also have brakes/locks to help hold it in place, also. Some legs have "levelers". As an option, I do recommend getting a cover for the table if you store it so that it will be kept clean and dry when not in use. Watch for a BIG variation in quality of these covers, tho. The cost begins around $25.00.  but is well worht it.
I did a lot of research on tables, as they are anywhere from $100 up to $1,000... was looking for an entry level, family table for home use and this turned out to easily be the best value for money.  It took only 30 minutes to assemble, which can be done mostly by one person except for a couple times where two people are best in order to lift the table tops.  While it is not as heavy or sturdy as the $1,000 models, it is quite stable and will do the trick for most home uses.  It is also easy to flip up to practice or storage position (my 10y old can do it), and is easy to move.  The one flaw that I would point out is that the small screws that secure the stabilizer arms to the underside of the table top are not quite up to the job.  Two arms have already come out of their screw holes.  Fortunately, replacing those with slightly larger, sturdier screws worked fine to re-attach them.  I would suggest Stiga look into this particular aspect of the design/construction, as it would be a simple fix for them to increase the durability of the table.
It was time to throw out my 17 year old ping pong table and get a new one. I was deciding between the thinner tables and this thicker wooded one and decided to pay extra for the thicker. I don't regret. The amazon shipping process was a little annoying, it did not come on the day I scheduled. I spoke to Amazon customer service and they couldn't tell me why but received 75 dollar courtesy because of it. I didn't complain, that's very good! The table finally arrived and it was packed very well. Two guys came to place it in my garage. The table was super heavy! I had my brother come to help out assemble it. The assembly process was astonishingly easy, you simply had to put the wheels on! The two separate table sides never need joining which is cool. The table was good to go in like 20 minutes. The bounce is crisp, consistent. The table looks awesome. The net is very easy to clamp on and tension, although the bottom part of the net has no tensioner and is very loose. Maybe I'm doing it wrong, I'll have to see how I can do it. Perhaps most satisfying is when I fold the table, the profile of the table is small. My previous old table looked huge compared to how it was designed when folded. Wife doesn't even notice it in garage corner. I'm looking forward to years of play!
The one I received has serious material and manufacturing quality problems. The red locking mechanism is scratching the U-shaped bar making it difficult to click in place. More over, the board is not able to hold the screws. Within 1 month I have 7 screws falling out already, and one segment of the steel reinforcement tube falling off. Not a happy customer! Update: After contacting them, they replaced the table for me very quickly. The new one is good, changing from 1 star to 4 stars.
Really Neat!! Great table. Right from the delivery which was in a good package to the ease of assemble. You really do not need to do much to assemble the table. You just need to put the wheels by your self and rest is already set. This table is easy to store after each play. You can fold and lock and then roll up to the corner or garage where ever you wanted and store it. Over all i am very happy with this product.
This is not the flimsy ping pong table that was in your parent's basement when you leaned a little on it, it collapsed! It was easy to set up, solid and folds easily.  Worth every penny.
We just got it yesterday. Very solid table. Very heavy too. Needs two people to set it up.
We love it. Researched a bit and after some not so good cheaper tables we had bought over the years, we bought this. Its great, nice looking, good bounce for the serious player.
Recived table today. Came in a great package and only took less then 10 min to assemble. The wheels are the only thing that need to be assembled. Table looks like its a good quality product. I like it because It is easy to store and this way it doesnt take up valuable space when not used. Already played in the single use mode. Love it!
The Stiga Advantage Indoor Table Tennis Table is amazing. My husband and I were doing a lot of research on different types of table tennis tables and comparing many different brands. We have owned table tennis tables before (lower quality and cheaper price), but this one is definitely worth the price. From our experience, as avid table tennis players, the Stiga Advantage table is holding up its end of the bargain. Everything from delivery to set-up met our expectations. Delivery was in between the scheduled window. They even brought it into the garage. The assembly was quite easy and quick. My husband and I worked together and got it up and playable within a half hour. Once the first half of the table was done, the second half was a cinch to set-up. The table seems sturdy, easy to breakdown for storage, and easy to set-up for the playback option. We especially liked the clamp-style net.  We definitely would recommend this product to others.
Just received the table today after purchasing it a week ago. Delivery was perfect, came earlier than expected! The table was top notch, no marks, scrapes, dents, etc. Looks very professional. I ordered the pro table, would highly recommend! My friends and I love using the table and compete against each other all the time. It's very easy to fold up and store away. It's kept in our two car garage with still plenty of room available. Overall the quality, playability, aesthetics and assembly is beyond expectation! Time flies when you're having fun :) Also, the assembly took about 5 minutes, so easy! It is a little heavy so make sure to have a friend there to help so you don't get any dents or scratches :D Have fun!
This was a bit of an impulse purchase after playing some spirited table tennis matches with friends- it was great to bring back memories along with have fun, and even work up a bit of a sweat! The Stiga Advantage Lite is such a great value for the price. While not as thick as traditional playing surfaces, I would venture that the average player would not notice the difference. I felt the bounce was pretty true. You can't beat the mobility and convenience- easily assembled and stored in the garage, and I can still park 2 cars in it. Can't recommend the Lite enough as a recreational table for your home, porch, or garage!
Wanted to find a durable table for my 10 and 7 year old to play this summer.  This table is very sturdy and took about 30 min to put together. ( It was not difficult at all - just a little time consuming for 1 person).  We were up and running in no time and we were the hit of the culdesac!  I love that you can easily fold it and store it with minimal space needed.  Would definitely recommend this table!  (We bought the least expensive option.)
Many other reviews say that their screws fall out regularly. My table came shipped with many screws out and pieces removed from the table completely. I get that shipping a table together is no easy task but if you market this 95% put together... then you should be able to deliver on that promise.
I just received my table.  I received it sooner than expected which I think is always a good thing.  The main reason I bought this is because I didnt want to spend hours putting a table together.  I want to start playing right away.  It took a few minutes to unpack as the table is well protected for shipping, but once out of the box, we were playing in no time.  It was as easy to assemble as described and the fact that the net was included was a bonus.  Like most tables I saw when researching my purchase, paddles and balls are not included so make sure you have this already or buy a set at the same time you buy the table.  I also like that when stored its easily portable and takes up less space than a lot of other tables out there.  Looking forward to enjoying this with family and friends for many years.
After hours of research reading a dozen articles and table ratings, the Stiga was my choice based on prior buyers experience, manufacturer reputation, and product quality. There was a lot of ranting and raving about how quickly the table assembled (and it did!) but who cares? No matter how long it took to put together, in the end I wanted a name brand, solid quality, good looking, and long-lasting table. It scores high marks with me on all points. It came sooner than expected (through TWO snowstorms along the way!), less than a week from the time I clicked 'order'. It was boxed in a double (triple, even) reinforced package, and arrived 100% complete, in perfect condition, not a scratch on it. I moved the table parts (myself) from the garage to the basement, and had it assembled in about 45 mins total time (I highly recommend having someone there to help, it was incredibly heavy and was at the absolute limit of what I could carry/move safely by myself). Fit and finish is excellent, and it looks, functions, and plays exactly as the manufacturer describes. For the price (including the delivery!) this table simply cannot be beat. And this review comes from someone who by nature is an incredibly fussy perfectionist (I checked every square inch of the table for errant marks or scratches, I checked every screw, nut and bolt (there are over 150!) to make sure they were tightened at the factory correctly), and I am a fairly aggressive amateur player (who was trained by a firehouse captain years ago, back in the days pre-dating cell phones, video games, cable TV,, there was nothing to do in the firehouse except cook, clean, eat, sleep, and play ping-pong in between all that!).  Based on my purchase experience, I'd say click 'buy now' and GO-FOR-IT !!
This is a very nice table. Delivery was easy, professional, and I was kept up to date throughout the entire shipping process. It took just over a week to arrive, but I was aware at the time I ordered it when I could expect it. This table is very heavy, we opened the box and brought it in pieces up to our bonus area. The only thing we had to do was put the casters on it. The directions were clear and it was very easy. Once those are on the table is a breeze to move, and we have pretty thick carpet where we keep the table. The table is very sturdy and the adjustable feet make it easy to adjust so that the game area is level. The net is a breeze to take off and put on as well. I love how easy it is to play alone, the table flips up and stabilizes in a matter of a few seconds and its not heavy at all. Im rather impressed with how easy it is to both move, adjust, fold up and store given how heavy the table is. Make sure to measure your area, we did and even though we knew what to expect it is a pretty big table! Super nice, I do hope it holds up for years to come though, seems like it would.
The Stiga Advantage Pro is an excellent value for a 3/4" table top with beefy support legs and quality. Comparable 3/4" tables from Butterfly or Joola would cost hundreds more. The shipping container was well designed, and there was no damage when the product arrived. The table was easy to assemble and comes in 2 separate halves, which get assembled individually. Each half rolls on its own and it's easy to move and set up. The folding of the table can be done with a 1 man operation. The tables plays great for our needs. I love the quality feel of the components and net hardware. The net stays taut, and it easy to set up and take down. The main difference from the Advantage Pro vs. the Advantage was the table top thickness coming in at 3/4" vs. 5/8" respectively and also the thickness of the support legs with the Pro having a heavier gauge metal. Overall, the Advantage Pro table is more than enough for our skill level, and we'll grow with the table for years to come.
Its  sturdy  & heavy duty, which makes it good quality. The delivery was on time. The packaging was nice and easy as were the directions. My husband and i were easily able to put it together. My 11 year old and 9 year old son have been playing with it nonstop. Thank you!
VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!  First on this thing weighs a ton.  Is not easy to move around.  When it arrives you can barely hold it up on your own.  Then unpacking it will take at least 2-3 people and to top it off THERE WERE NO INSTRUCTIONS TO PUT THE DA*% THING TOGETHER.  I am most disappointed.  Oh and did I mention the color is not as bright a blue as the pic!?--and that was one of the reasons I picked that table.  And the tools it needs to put together are NOT ones I readily have on hand.  Really really mad.
This is a review of the second table I received.  The first arrived damaged, but the damage was not evident on the carton, and we didn't discover it until we started assembly.  After a brief (less than 15 minutes to lodge the complaint and arrange the details of replacement) call to Amazon, a new table was shipped immediately, and pickup for the damaged table was arranged.  My sons and heir friends love the table.  It is sturdy and attractive.  I would buy it again if I needed 2!
We ordered this bc it was the best, low-end table we could find on Amazon.  It shipped quickly and the box had a little damage.  There was a small corner piece 'bumper' that broke off from shipping, but it is trivial.  There was a vital part missing....the 4th wheeled leg assembly.  I emailed, then went to their 'chat' site and was almost immediately told the part was being shipped.  I was very surprised with the quick service. I fabricated a quick fix to the missing leg so we could play.  I checked the level of the table by spinning a ball in place to see if it would roll.....perfectly level (luck, not skill).  I'm sure a thicker table would be somewhat better in terms of bounce, but I can't imagine how discernible.  The shipping box is HEAVY, so I understand the likelihood in damage (again we were lucky).
I had read all of the reviews so I had a mind set that the table would be of exceptional quality, easy to set up, and fun to use.  All of those things proved to be true.  The only reason I have not given the Table Tennis Table five stars is there was some damage during shipment.  The underside of one of the two adjoining table had gauges from the box containing the wheels.  The box containing the wheels needs a little more cushioning to avoid the sharp angles of the wheels being pushed against the table board during shipment.  Fortunately it was on the underside and had no impact on the play or outward appearance. This is a very niceTable Tennis Table, at a fair price.
I am a player with about 1900 USATT rating. Bought quick for gaming at home during the COVID-19 thinking it might be not far from the ITTF approved standard. But to my disappointment, the features of the surface is too far from the standard. Its bouncing is so much less. One of the table top is warped out of the box. The game quality is from standard minus dropped to purely recreational. I DO NOT recommend this table to anyone who are expecting to play some serious games!
An exceptionally beautiful table; well made, sturdy, and easy to store.  It was very well packed in a purpose-made shipping box; it was lined with a veneer of masonite, had thick, plastic corner protectors, and cardboard-and-gypsum liners on all four sides. Safe transit was virtually assured, so that's why I was surprised to find the underside of one table section scarred in several places.  It had to have happened during manufacturing/packaging, as the box arrived undamaged in that area.  Although it doesn't affect the table's usefulness, it is somewhat unsightly when folded for storage. All pieces and parts were included (nothing missing) and packaged well; also, the directions were clear, proper English, straightforward, and simple to follow.  In fact, one only has to attach the four caster legs on the two table halves (2 on each half).  I needed 2 metric box end wrenches (ratcheting wrenches made the process quicker) to complete the job; it took me a total of 10 minutes to assemble the table (5 minutes to unbox, and 5 minutes to attach the caster legs) then clip on the net and it's ready for play.  Note: a second person is required to flip the table halves onto the rolling caster legs when complete.  My wife and I simplified the process by laying the table half on a folding table for assembly, and then just tilted the assembled table half onto the floor (my wife's a genius). Even though the table has "underbelly" damage, I still rate it 5 stars for the packaging, build quality, and ease of assembly.  I'll be looking for a storage cover for it next, and an organizer for all my STIGA paddles and balls.
Fantastic table.  I got notice in advance that delivery was being delayed from Friday to Monday (which wasn't an issue), but looking at my order details I think they may have given a credit for this.  I noticed another review where this happened and they indicated the same $75 price reduction. This was well packed, which is good since it's about 200lbs - perfect condition out of the box even though the exterior box took some hits.  Assembly was quick and easy and I've been able to tuck this away for Christmas. From what I can tell so far, the weight on this translates to durability.  It feels very solidly build, but is easy to move around once the wheels are on. Time will tell, but this seems like it will hold up to a large group of kids for many years.  Well worth the price.
The product is positioned at specific price segment.  The challenge is the product components compared to relatively more expensive options are remarkably lower quality.  The surface is quite thin and ball makes lot more noise compared to thicker boards.  The steel used to reinforce the boards from sagging is quite thin.  The nets are always about an inch above the table because of the clamps system.  Each of these cost components are of much lower quality than say next higher priced table.  Hence I would put a two or two and half star on the product. The reason I am giving one star is additional challenge I faced with this product as it came with several screws missing where steel rod attaches to the board, making the board sag.  Getting customer care to respond in timely manner and understand the issue even after sending photographs, invoices, order details/proof was just plain sad.  I have lot of empathy for customer services team due to COVID but such response was not below expectations even after factoring in the current situation.  This item is heavy hence returns are painful.  Finally I got them to ship me the screws after 4 weeks of back and forth.  And they send screws that are 5 inches long versus what the table takes.  I have to hunt in box stores to find the right size screws as Amazon return window expired by the time they send the wrong screws. Overall disappointed with product and the customer service.
We spent $400 on this Stiga table, trusting we would get years of quality. We've only had it for a month and the metal "joints" that allow the table halves to fold up have already buckled and the paint has chipped when trying to fold the table as directed in the instructions. The gauge of steel or whatever metal was used is ridiculously thin. I don't know how the manufacturer can sleep at night knowing they are putting such a heavy table top over such flimsy supports. The "joints" are probably a safety hazard considering how easily they buckle. We'll see how our personal ping pong table saga unfolds as I feel Stiga should be fully held responsible for poor manufacturing but at the very least I can warn you NOT to purchase this table.
Husband bought this to keep us from going stir-crazy during the pandemic of 2020. It was very easy [for a couple of non-DIYers like us] to set it up. Extremely easy to roll around and fold up. We store it every day after playing so the cars can get back in the garage. Only complaint is that the allen wrench which came with the table lacked sufficient torque capacity to secure the carriage bolts. Thankfully we have a DIY neighbor who provided us with a ratchet wrench and a regular wrench which made securing the bolts easy-peasey. Even with this issue, it was fully assembled and ready for play within 1 hour. Be aware that the shipping company will not roll it past a house on a driveway to a garage; nor will the driver help get the ~150 lb. container into the house, and they also did not call us to schedule when they were delivering it. All these potential issues were with the shipper and since during a pandemic everyone is home, they did not present any issues for us.
The table in general is a nice  idea - easy to  fold and put away and easy to reassemble. However, it has  very poor quality. Ours turned really poor. First it took almost 2 months to deliver . I understand it might not be a manufacturer fault. May be because of delayed shipping it came with all turned up box.  When we unpacked several of the  metal strut were pulled off the the panel and essentially it is not usable.  I checked the screws and they all stripped, so the rest of struts probably will fall out in a while if you use this table. Mesh has holes. And the mesh attachments are a simple , not adjustable spring clamp. As mesh is sort it pules them up and essentially is higher  then should be. In summary, nice idea but poorly executed and assembled and came broken after  2 months wait. Got a refund, now I have  to haul this heavy  table from the basement to the dumpster. Really disappointed.
Got this on sale for Christmas.  Easy to setup and seems to be a solid table.  Using on an outdoor screened porch so hope it holds up.  Bought the cover to keep it safe when not in use.  Pros: 1. Seems sturdy.  The two halves don't connect in any way.  I wasn't sure about this to begin with, but the clamps for the net seem to do a good job of holding it together.  The wheels lock to keep it from moving when playing.  Net is solid. 2. Heavy but not too heavy that you can't move it or open/close it by yourself. 3. Folds up nicely and nests so it doesn't take up too much room when not in use. Cons: 1. Came a little banged up.  I blame UPS for being careless with it but a little better packaging could have prevented this. Some scratches on it and the laminate is bent in a few places.  I'll glue it back and try to touch up the scratches as I have no hope that a re-order would be any different.  That said I'm just too lazy to try to do any sort of return.  For what I paid I'm ok with it. 2. Not the sturdiest table I've ever used but sturdy enough for regular family use.  If you want a pro level table be prepared to spend a lot more.  Didn't want to buy a super heavy duty table for a porch and wasn't prepared to shell out several hundred for a true outdoor table.  For the price seems like an overall good value. 3. If you write a review, they'll send you a dozen free balls.  Nice touch.  Now I just need to buy a couple ball/paddle holders to attach underneath.
The table was easy to set-up and the price was reasonable for how sturdy and attractive it is. Feels like it will last a long time. The only thing to note is that the 2 halves slip apart easily because they are only attached by a giant clip. This makes it easy to move around, separate, and use for solo play, but the 2 halves do slip out of alignment. This is a 2-second fix though so it isn't a problem. Overall this table is very substantial and we love it! Its such a good way to have the kids (9 & 12) moving and playing with us for an hour or more and having so much fun!
I've had this table for a week, and I like it more and more each passing day. It was delivered on time and the table was in perfect condition when we opened the box to assemble it. As advertised, the table was 95% pre-assembled...all I had to do was attach the wheels and screw in the leg levelers. You definitely want two people for the job because you want to be able to flip the two giant pieces of table safely and effectively. Getting the table unpacked, assembled, and ready for play took 30-40 minutes. Just this morning, I needed to "store" the table...it took 3 minutes...the two halves nest into one another so it's slim. Overall, I'm so so pleased with this table. If I had to do it all over again...I'd buy this table every single time - and I did SO much research. Convenience, design, quality...it tops the charts. Now keep in mind, this is not a professional tournament table that weights 300lbs and costs $1600. This probably isn't up to snuff for the professional or serious table tennis player...but for a family of 4 who has grandparents, aunts and uncles over and are looking to have a friendly fun game of ping pong? This table deserves 10 stars!
I wanted to get a ping pong table for my husband, who has longed to have one for years. Last Christmas I purchased this table and I never could have imagined how great a gift it would end up being. First of all, it was delivered promptly and the guys who carried it in must have eaten their Wheaties that morning because this thing weighs a ton! It was fairly easy to put together, I did it by myself and I am a small female. I needed help from my son to turn it upright, however. It is a beautiful table, extremely well-built and attractive. It was a great buy, too. Best of all, during the pandemic it has served to be a great distraction and I imagine as the cold weather keeps us all indoors and social-distancing, my husband and I will be battling it out in the basement , playing a lot of ping pong!
The product itself was in pristine condition thankfully since I was told that the box was coming from the opposite side of the US. I had purchased this ping pong table and they force you to make a delivery appointment that works for you and so I proceeded to do that. Couple days later, it didn't matter since they changed the delivery date/time on me, but it worked for me anyway so I waited for about 2 weeks and the night before I get a phone call from the third party delivery service verifying my order and then letting me know that it would be nearly impossible for me to receive it since it was all the way on the opposite coast....OKAY. Super inconvenient, but I was being patient and I triple checked with the delivery service & amazon to make sure that I would receive it the following week. THE DAY FINALLY COMES...I had a 4 hour window that they were supposed to deliver it and 5 minutes before the end of that window I end up calling the delivery service AGAIN and was on the phone for 20 minutes until someone finally picked up and let me know that yet AGAIN it wasn't coming. I am fed up and furious at this point and end up making the delivery two days later and then called up amazon and finally someone understood the BS I had to go through and got a credit for the inconvenience which was nice, but seriously the whole experience was utter crap. I was told they would call me at least 30 minutes in advance before they arrived and no phone call and the delivery guy just showed up to the door got my signature and didn't even bother to bring the damn ping pong table to the front step of my house. Screw CEVA...never heard of them and I will never allow them to delivery anything to me ever again.
This is a beautiful table. It arrived promptly. We had it delivered to the garage because we knew it would be heavy. There we opened the box and we (2 adults - not weight lifters) moved each section downstairs by putting it on a blanket and dragging it to the staircase. It was easy to get down the stairs and into the basement. Setting it up was a snap. Read the directions because there are two brackets for each leg, not one. Reading is important, but set up was truly a cinch. I looked for tables online for a long time. STIGA had the best reputation, but I was worried about the quality. It is important to me to have the right table and this one surpasses expectations. It is also worth investing in these paddles. WOW! Together with the table, these are amazing. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079KXSGYC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Delivered promptly with no issues. First the order got struck due to winter storm and Amazon said it is going to be delayed but instead it got delayed even before the said time. No package damage and product arrived with no visible marks. Playability: I played in many table but not to this quality so I could not achieve the spin I put in but with this I have no problem getting the right spin as I went for Pro grade and it helped a lot. Quality: This was top notch no real quality issue. the surface was intact and over frames where really constructed very well. If I have to nitpick this is one area where I saw some painting issue and a minor hair line scratch on the surface (not immediately visible but only when observed). Aesthetics: This table can be folded and stored which I believe is very portability that has been given and For the price this has good aesthetics but I would have considered adding ball storage atleast for pro level but not a big issue. Assembly: This is by far the best, the product somes with 95 -98% assembled. All you have to do is unpack and add the wheels to each table and put the net and play thats it. Manual is very well instructed so this is the best with this order. Overall I am happy with this purchase.
This review is not for the product, but for Amazon Service. i've always been happy with Amazon service until now. I bought a ping pong table and selected assembly help as the website made it seem that it was extremely difficult to put together. the technician took less than 15 minutes to screw in some wheels and that was it! The bullet point under assembly said it takes an average of 3 hours to build.  what did i pay $75 for? The exercise bike that i bought through amazon was much more difficult to assemble and that service wasn't even offered. the customer service told me she would credit me $10 and when i told her i wasn't happy, she said sorry, there's nothing she can do, and she left the chat! Didn't even credit me $10.
I'm a huge fan of this table.  It looks great, and offers a very solid surface that I don't worry about putting my body weight on when I'm diving for short shots.  Thick, high quality play surface is as good as any table I've played on... very impressed. The downside of such a thick & high quality playing surface is how heavy the delivered table is.  I ended up opening the box upstairs and bringing to the two halves downstairs in separate trips.  I would strongly recommend you just wait until you have help so you don't risk injury... the first half I got down okay but the second half took its toll and regretted moving it all myself.  Once all the pieces are in the right room though, setup was simple and seems fairly sturdy, with one caveat... The very first time I folded out the table, it looks like one of the support beams/brackets near the hinge got bent.  I was able to roughly straighten it back out, but I think there's a weak point that you're going to have to watch carefully if you're going to be folding and unfolding the table often.  For us, it's not getting folded back up often so it doesn't really matter... but it's worth mentioning. Overall this is a great table, and we're already getting a bunch of use out of it.
This table's description states that the table top is 5/8 inches thick. I measured the table thickness. It is not 5/8, but 9/16th inches (see picture) - 1/16 " thinner than advertised. To put this in perspective, the Stiga Advantage Pro, which is listed as 3/4" , or 1/8" thicker than this table, currently sells for $100 more ($400 vs $500) on Amazon. In other words, the up-charge for 1/8 of an inch thickness is $100. So a 1/16 " difference in thickness equates to about $50, or 12.5% of the table's sale price of $400. Also, I tried to contact the "manufacturer" (actually the distributor for US market, as far as I can see), Escalade Sports to ask them whether the 5/8" was a misrepresentation of the product, or I was sent the wrong table. First time, I called their phone number. I talked to a lady who was clueless about ping pong tables, and even wondered if my question was a "trick" question. After I assured her that it definitely was not, she took my number and promised she would have someone get back to me with answers to the table's specs. I never got a call back from anyone. I then sent them an email. I got a confirmation email with a "case number", a promise that they will get back to me as soon as possible, and a note about response times "may be slower than normal" due to covid-19. After hearing nothing from them after 3 business days, I sent them a follow-up email. This was 3 days ago. So after waiting for 8 days and 2 emails to them, I gave up hope on ever hearing back from them. I am aware of the nominal vs actual thickness for plywood. However, I am not buying plywood. I am buying a ping pong table with a specified table thickness. And as far as I can see, there is no disclaimer anywhere on Amazon's product listing, on Escalade Sports' website, or on the manual that came with the table about any nominal vs actual thickness. So, due to the a) Misrepresentation of the ping pong table's specs, and b) Complete unresponsiveness of the "manufacturer", I am rating the table with 2 stars. If you have read reviews and recommendations of ping pong tables, and care about the thickness of the table, know that this table's actual thickness is dangerously close to the "wouldn't recommend even for casual players" category.
Bought it with a good deal. Arrived on time. The package is very professional and provides great protection to the table and parts. Great look, good quality metal pieces, and wooden surface. Fun to play on it! Obviously, our cat loves it too! The assembly is straightforward, it takes about 20 minutes. But you might need a pair of pliers to hold the screw on one side so you can turn it on the other side with the provided tool, wish this could be improved on later versions. Overall, highly recommended for anyone who enjoys ping pang.
No shipping comments - here is a photo.  Product, as received. Strongly suggest that you buy an item of this nature LOCALLY. Update:  Escalade Sports has no replacement parts for this discontinued item. EMAILS on request. DO NOT BUY. Company  has no mechanism for shipment of repair parts, for this item.  Item discontinued. Table will not properly level.  Product is total unsupported junk.  Company confused, and unable to provide any support. After two shipment  attempts?  I repaired my "new" item with shop tools, and an Oak side strut.  AVIOD this firm - two Amazon challenges on this junk, and I don't think it's an AMAZON issue.  This is just a very BAD company - Please avoid them.  This product is total trash.
This is a great table for this price point. $400 sounds like a lot but in the TT world, its really not and you get a decent Stiga table for this price. Bounce is good, assembly is literally in minutes out of the box. You only need to attach the lower portion of the feet with wheels. The clamping system for the net is easy and self levels the two halves. The worst part about this table was the Amazon shipping process. Scheduled delivery sounds good but its not what is advertised. They give you multiple 3hr windows to select between Mon-Sat to find out thats not the case. They outsource the shipping to different companies. We picked a Fri 3-6pm since my brother works overnights and wanted to be up when they came. We get a call 2 days before from the shipping company saying that 3-6 Fri was not an option because it is based on how they scheduled their drop offs for the day. Our only options were Fri early morning or Monday afternoon. They dont deliver on Saturdays even though Amazon had this as an option. So we ended up going with the Monday option (3 days later than the original day and lost a weekend of playing). The delivery itself was fine. The box was kind of banged up but the table was in good shape. Small banged up part under one of the corners but nothing significant. So if youre looking for a concrete delivery day and time based on your schedule, beware whatever you choose might not actually be the case once the carrier receives it and makes their own schedule and rules.
I took a gamble and bought this table as a Christmas present despite some horror story type reviews. I was fortunate to get it delivered with only a minor injury from shipping (see photo). The table top was unscathed and we weren't missing any parts. Overall great table! Assembly: 20 minutes with 4 people. The table tops alone are incredibly heavy. Luckily, it's "95% assembled" as it states on the box. You just have to screw on the legs with the casters. Flipping them over was the biggest task so make sure you and your help are strong and are protecting your back in the process. We had no issues with misaligned holes or missing pieces. Maneuverability: Easy and no longer heavy thanks to the casters. I'm only 4'10 and I have no problem rolling out, unfolding and putting the table together myself. The table breaks down into two separate pieces and are held together with the net clamps. We were concerned this wouldn't be sufficient for game play but really the clamps are all you need. Quality: Recreational play approved. We just like ping pong. We're not pros but we do enjoy the quality of this particular table. The clamp for the net makes for very quick set up. We played for hours each day the first week we got it. Storage: Very small footprint! See photo As mentioned, the table breaks down to two separate pieces that are easy to move on casters. The two pieces sandwich together and don't take much space at all. The tables are held upright with a latch so they don't fall open while you're wheeling them around. We live in southern California so humidity is only intense in the summer. It's been in our garage with no cover for the past two weeks and it's fine. We shall see how it holds up to summer.
This table is very sturdy and is well built. Its easy to fold up and not a chore to do at all, like some tables. When I have family over and we arent playing ping pong, I quickly fold it up and roll it into the corner and its not even an eyesore. But most importantly, how does it play? The table top has a fantastic response. A dull table can kill any enthusiasm for ping pong and this one will keep you playing for hours, like I have been. Having a ping pong table was one of my dreams for when I bought my first house. When it finally happened, I chose a Stiga.
Poorly made. Most of the screws (at least 30)came undone in transit so the frame and the locking mechanism were not attached.  The description says 95% assembled but would still have taken at least 70/90 minutes to put together. We returned it for the JOOOLA which was $50 more expensive but better made. Plus it only took 15 mins to assemble.
After researching for a while I found this table. A friend who is an avid player highly recommended Stiga and he was right.  This is good table  (sturdiness, material table, ease of assembly) for hours and hours of fun. Assembly was easy and also folding up the table to make room when not is use is super convenient. BUT the hinge to lock the table (see pictures) in place when folded was installed off center. Therefore it won't lock.  I assembled the table solo but you might need a friend in the end to help flip the table.  It's a good deal but not perfect. Customer service from Escalade Sports replied within a few days and is now working with me to replace the table so for that alone this Stiga table tennis table is super worth it.
The delivery service was very timely however when bringing the ping pong table in my door they broke my door sensor for my alarm. Not a big deal right until I call my security company and find out that it cost $40 to replace that sensor. Mistakes happen and I don't want the fellows to get into trouble so OK.  Then when on boxing the ping pong table one of the frame bases is bent quite a bit as shown in the photo.
Great so far but unsure of durability around the edges, though with children using it what actually lasts these days? The packaging of the product was outstanding, with some particle board pieces around the inside of the box to protect the product.  It arrived via fright shipping in pristine condition.  The box had some wear outside in the corners but I dont think this impacts the product itself too easily. The rubber casters are great and their locking mechanism sturdy.  The frame to support the table is higher quality and the folding style and safety latch work really well.  I can actually move and store this without sacrificing too much space.
I have been researching for a good Ping Pong table for my kids for a while. When my brothers and I are still kids, we love the Ping Pong table in the basement and used to play on it all the time. I think it really helped our hands-eye coordination and developed our interests in sports. After months of research, Stiga was my choice based on the review and the brand reputation. I decided to go for Advantage Pro for better playability and thicker surface. I think the pro is a nice choice since you want a table that is closer to a pro level design. The delivery was quicker than I expected. The package was a bit heavy so you need to a bit careful when moving and unpacking. The assembly was fairly easy. I had my son helped me and it was done in 20min. The quality of the table feels pretty solid. The table surface was good and smooth, however there are some small chips and scratches on the back, but nothing serious. Overall the table feels like a solid piece! To be honest, the surface feel is not as great as these $1000 tables which I had played before, but overall it is definitely at upper side and the price is great! But compare to Advantage, if your budget allows, go for the Pro. I originally plan to put it garage, but kids and I love it so much we decided to leave it in the family room so we can play all the time. Both my son and daughter would just go straight to play when they come back to school. This also resulted in less screen time for my kids. Haha.  Its a great buy! If you like ping pong go for it!!!
I was struggling between buying the Advantage and the Advantage Pro.  I ended up with the Advantage and couldn't be happier.  I'm not a professional but I'm pretty good and there's no way I would notice a difference between how a ball bounces off a 5/8" top versus a 3/4" top.  I'm also very happy about the quality: very sturdy, large casters for easy rolling, easy to flip up and store, plus a really nice net. Me and my 14 year old assembled the table in under 10 minutes.  There are 4 legs with casters that need to be bolted onto pre-drilled posts - 8 bolts total.  After that, you just clip on the net.  I had the level out but didn't even have to make any height adjustments.  So easy.
Updating the review to three stars.  Escalade Sports came through and will be delivering a new table to us, so props to them!  It is quite easy to set up and take down, however, and takes up minimal space.  The ball- bounce is really good, but the table does scuff rather easily and leaves "blue dots" on the ball (we can live with that). Just keep in mind that this table is made of particle board, not MDF (some other websites may incorrectly list this), and this is why the screws came right out.  It would be nice if they could use some sort of glue with the screws to help stabilize the bond. Original review: This table is cheaply made. The screws on the bottom ripped right off the first time we set it up.
The STIGA ping pong table has become our familys entertainment center. It is better than my expectations and after opening the extremely well done protective packaging we were playing on it within a half hour. It is almost completely assembled with the exception of eight easy to install bolts for metal struts, four on each of the rolling halves. The surface is smooth and solid and professional appearing. My only recommendation would be to add a clamp or hook and eye to mechanically keep the tables tightly together rather than depending on the net clamps and wheel locks. Overall opinion is fantastic!
For its specifications,  this is the best in its class.  Better than the comparable Joola (Inside 15mm model).  I was able to compare as I got this and my neighbor got Joola. One thing to note is, if you expecting to compete in leagues and trying anything that is more than recreational, you may want to consider upgrading to a thicker table-table than this.  Again,  to re-iterate, for the table-top thickness of 15.875mm,  this performs awesome.  But you will see a difference in the bounce and the sound it makes when compared to the tournament/club tables.  Just something for you to be aware of. Otherwise,  nice sturdy and easy to handle table, nice clamp net. Hope this helps.
The table came in with a defective roller leg assembly. The pre-drilled holes in one leg assembly with casters are misaligned. The holes In this leg are on different locations than the other three legs, causing the table noticeably higher in the middle when the two halves are pieced together. Instead of going through the hassle of replacing the entire table with Amazon, I called the manufacturer customer support to get a replacement roller leg assembly. The assembly arrived in 10 days. The issue was fixed immediately after the replacement leg assembly arrived. The table is sturdy. Easy to fold and move away when not in use. Other than the leg issue, it seems to be a solid product.
Over all I like this ping pong table. The assembly was easy and it appears to be solid. I say a generous 4 since we do like it and enjoy using it. The only downfall to this item is a very bad design flaw. We got the Advantage Lite which only has a 1/2 thick table top. I assume that is why there is support bracing on the underside. All of this support is attached with #6 screws. #6 screws are not big enough to bite into the particle board table top. A lot of the screws were lose and some were out completely when I received it. After putting them back in, taking care not to strip the holes, I thought we were in business. After just an hour or so of use, the crews started falling out. It was an easy fix by replacing the screws with #8 1 1/4 wood screws. If the manufacture would attach the support bracing with #8 screws, I think this make this a very solid table and one that people could enjoy right out of the box without having to make "repairs". I admit I did not reach out to customer support yet, since the fix was much easier / quicker than anything they could have done.
The good points.  The ping pong table was easy to assemble and played very well.  It seemed very sturdy and the balls bounced well. I liked the way that it played.  When it was folded up it fit well in a corner of my house.  The biggest issue is that it almost crushed my daughter. I was putting up one side of the table and the other side collapsed to the floor.  It almost crushed my daughter and dog who were less than a foot away.  Because it it two pieces it can fall down.  Also putting it up and down is a pain.  You have to unlock the wheels and then move one piece at a time.  We had to send it back and ended up getting a one piece MD sports which was cheaper, easier to move and plays pretty well (the setup was much harder but worth it).
only had it a couple days. review is based on assembly and shipping had the professional option to move it upstairs through a tight staircase. The actual comment from the 2 people were (is this a marble table cause this is extremely heavy). I would highly recommend this being moved by a professional but there are options if you are trying to save. The table are 2 different pieces and can be moved 1 at a time (without the wheels) You should inspect the inside prior to letting the moving guys leave. Assembly is nice since majority of it is done. You only need to install the caster legs. We did find that 3 washers were missing (we looked and i just used some spares i had). One of the stationary rubber feet feel off in transport. Would be better if the legs were NOT pre-assembled as it's just a simple screw in and it would possibly prevent any damage due to it floating around in the box. You will need a socket head and a small wrench to tighten in the bolt to assemble the legs. With a couple hours of play it is a very nice table. My only concern is the net. It clamps onto the table and I would think over time the table would get worn out. Easy to move, and raise the table to move out of the way. - sturdy - easy to break down and move in 2 parts (and be used as solo backboard play) - material is higher finish - net is easy to adjust and move - the red accents to the lock are a nice visual touch to see how it locks into place. - the packing material was nice but could be better if the rubber feet were installed by the user vs preinstalled - 95% of the table was already pre-assembled - you will need 2 people to turn and pick up the table for leg assembly
First, the good. Easy to set-up, not expensive ($400), and the family is having a lot of fun playing on it. Now, the not so good. The table is advertised as having a 5/8" top. Not true. It's just under 5/8". Not a big deal you may say, but these tables are made in a factory and the machines are set to a certain thickness. Which means Stiga knowlingly shaves just a few millimeters off the thickness of the table top on purpose. Next, the two halves of the table are completely independent. We are constantly adjusting one half so it meets up with the other. Would be nice to have some sort of latch underneath the table to lock them together. Finally, leveling is difficult because only the legs on the ends of the table are adjustable. The legs on the inside of the table (under the net) are not adjustable, so we end up putting shims of wood underneath them to get the table level. All in all. I would gladly have spent more money to purchase a better designed table. Btw, I did call up STIGA customer service to complain about the table. The guy gave a chuckle and then suggested I fill out a warranty application. Seemed like just a blow-off comment.
Love the table tennis, it is beautiful and it arrived on time. It is easy to assemble but you need two people, specially when you need to attach the rolling legs. We had several issues with the table and have written to the company, let's see what type of customer service they offer. This is poorly recreational so the table should do fine but still, it is expensive when the customer needs to fix it. I had attempted to contact the company, no replies, 0 customer service, if you buy it you will need to solve your  issues. Per all the reviews, it always arrives with something wrong but the company does not respond
The table is good, easy to assemble, but the delivery was awful, they dropped the package from the top of the truck to ground in front of my eyes, they turned the package on the corner edge carelessly so the table broke. I'll return it and buy another one, I recommend amazon  hire responsible delivery staff.
Nice looking table, good packaging.  Incredibly simple assembly.  However, like others, we had issues with the manufacturer-installed screws stripping out.  Our issue happened prior to delivery.  One part of the frame was not attached and the stripped screws were all over the box. The screws probably fell out during shipping, but I the issue is with the design or manufacturing, not careless shipping, as the exterior box was in very good shape. There is no real cross structure under the table surface itself.  I'm worried that if anyone leans on this even a little, the "wood" (actually particle board) of the table isn't going to hold.  The legs screw into the table surface directly.  It would be way better with a better metal frame connecting the legs to the metal on the edges and screws that don't fall out.  This additional cross structure would not require too much - perhaps just two metal side to side connection points. All indications had been that I had good delivery luck and the item was not damaged.... oh, well, these days most all big items arrive damaged.  I feel like I've won the lottery when large items aren't damaged. It's possible to use it anyway, so I've assembled it and will see how Stiga customer service does with replacement or other solutinos...
Bought this based on other reviews, and definitely the right decision. I didn't want a table that would take hours to set up.  This was literally screw in some legs and wheels and it's good to go.  And shout out to the Amazon delivery service - the guys helped me, which saved even more time since they'd obviously done it before, didn't need instructions, so it was done in minutes - then they hauled away the boxes and packing materials. I don't have a strong basis for comparison with other tables, but since I hadn't played much since I was a kid and my son is just learning, wanted a table that others said would be good for beginners as well as when our skills improved.  Went for the "Advantage", figuring worth a little more than the Advantage Lite but didn't want to spend extra for the Advantage Pro.  Using the Stiga rackets we also purchased it seems to just.....play, feel, and bounce right for us. Definitely a solid feel, not flimsy like some tables we've played at while on vacation.  Haven't tried putting one part vertical for solo play but it does roll around easy when we want to reposition it.  And the two halves stay together nicely when the clip-on net is holding them together.  I'd expected to have to position each half independently. I didn't really care about the appearance of the table but my wife approves - 'nough said :) I'm glad I didn't skimp and buy a super-cheap table and feel I got my money's worth on this one without needing to spend a whole lot more for a table where I don't know that I would have noticed the upgrade.
I bought this as a birthday gift for my 11 year old. He loves it! The table was delivered very well-packed. I did have two younger male friends put it together for me. As a single woman, I'm not sure I could have done it by myself, because the package was very heavy. Anyway, they were able to get it together where it's perfectly fitted together and level (that also took two people, as one held up the end and the other adjusted the little wheel things on the bottom). The table is very attractive (a dark blue top with sharp white markings). It seems very sturdy and it's not wobbly in any way. The net fits nice and tight across it. I'm looking forward to lots of play with my son, and I'm hoping it will help improve his hand-to-eye coordination. Since this was a gift for my son, I really took a chance because it wasn't something he had asked for. But he said it was his favorite birthday gift that he received. I'm very pleased!
I love the table - well designed and constructed. Amazon needs to care about delivery.  The delivery team said the item was too heavy to carry downstairs and that is their policy.  I had to bribe them to open the box and carry it down in 2 pieces.  Amazon makes promises it doesn't actually deliver via their subcontracted delivery services.  This is all Amazon's fault, not the two poor guys standing in my driveway.
Great quality, have been playing on some lately and this is just as nice if not nicer than some other $500 tables. Took about 15 minutes to put together alone, but that's just because of the weight and taking it down stairs. 4 bolts to fasten and a net to secure and you're good to go. In researching it all, this is obviously the same as the other Joomla table at the same price, really they are 100% the same, so go with whichever is cheaper.
The STIGA ADVANTAGE table tennis table offers great flexibility and ease in setup and regular play. For example, there is a playback mode offered in the table and it is extremely easy to switch from normal to playback mode. Changing it is as simple as folding and unfolding a portable 6' folding table. It takes less than a minute to switch from different modes. I like the playback mode a lot because it gives you the chance to play even when you don't have another player to play with. The net that comes with the table is nice and can be easily removed and put back on in seconds. Good for beginners as well as advanced players. Overall, a great ping-pong table! One thing I would recommend that you do is to protect the corners whenever the table is not in use. I did it with the packing that came in the box or you can do it with anything else. In fact, I cover up my table every night to protect it from dust. I would recommend doing that too. The box it came with was extremely heavy - definitely not one person job and may need a helping hand. Once out of the box, it is easy to set up and can be handled individually.
The table is lot of fun to play with.  The table is beautiful and solid. Easy to assemble, fold and store.  The only thing I've noticed is that the screws they used to secure the legs to the bottom of the table breaks easily. I've found several screws with head broken off. It needs to be address. Some screws are screwed in an angle to avoid hitting the broken off screws. (see pictures) I will try to fix/reinforce the legs to the table.  Overall the table is family approved.
This ping pong table is exactly what we have been looking for. We are recreational players and for us the quality for the price is excellent. The table was delivered via a freight company at a time that was scheduled with us. The box was extremely big and heavy so we were glad we didn't have to go pick it up at a store. My wife and I put it together in about 20 minutes. The table is basically all together except for adding the four wheeled brackets to the already installed legs and then clamping on the net. The clamp is heavy duty and also helps to hold the two separate tables together and evenly and was so simple to install. We like that the table is two separate table pieces. We will be using the ping pong table in 2 locations and easily carried each table piece up some stairs. Also, because it is 2 separate pieces if you need to store it, it flips up and you can roll the table pieces flat up to each other. Other portable tables I have looked at fold up with a couple feet of wasted space between the two pieces of table. Highly recommend this table
We purchased the Stiga table after searching endless reviews on all table options available to us online.  This is a quality table and the price value is fantastic!  To begin with... It's no small feat to deliver such a product, but the table arrived when they said it would, was delivered by a clean-cut and polite/friendly delivery team, and the table itself was an instant hit from the moment they showed up.  This was a slightly belated Fathers Day gift, and we have not let the table cool down since it arrived!  Not a mark or dent on it from factory to destination, great bounce, full size, attractive, easy to assemble, easy to fold and store, net is simple and perfectly straight.  We simply love it and can tell It will last for many years to come.  Hard to walk by it without picking up a paddle, and everyone is willing for a match or two.
I like the table because it exceeds the expectation in the given price segment. Package arrived on time and the table is sturdy. We wanted the table on second floor in our game room and it was very heavy, trick there is to un-package the contents and move the halves separately. Table come is two halves which we prefer because of the evenness. Surface is flat and even after clamping the two halves, this is big advantage of having two halves instead of four halves. Assembly is easy and quick. But you will need two person to assemble and move properly. Once assembled its easy to move and fold by a single person. changing the setting to one player mode is also very simple. Overall quality of paint and linings look great. we are using this table for over a month now and we love it.
Great table. I was looking for a beginner level table and had been researching a lot on the best economical yet functional product and Stiga Advantage stood out among all and is the best I found. My wife and I are ping pong enthusiasts and we play at recreation centers, friends' houses, and whenever we get a chance. This is an awesome table and way nicer than we anticipated. It looks great and is really solid and heavy. Delivery was great and the guys dropped it in the garage as only my wife was home when they came. I put the table together by myself in about 10 mins. I just needed another body to lift it up stairs and the easiest way to do so was to take piece by piece instead of the whole unit at once. As the table is essentially two tables, that conjoin at the net, you will need a second person to help lift a table and turn them over once the wheels are connected. The process overall was super simple. You'll need a couple pliers or wrenches to tighten the bolts but that's about it. It can store away really easy as you can put the tables at 90 degrees and roll them away. We haven't stored them as we've been busy playing on it almost daily, but I tested it out and it was very simple to do. We play a bunch now and are really loving it. Great table, high quality and great quality for the price!
We are using in ouside in our backyard and after we finish playing  we fold it and move it to q storage. It's very ease and to move around and store it. It was ease to assembe it as well. Just follow the instructions. The table came on time and we recommend it to everyone. My son is 15 years old and he plays a lot with his friends in the backyard. It was purchased during lock down due to Covid-19 and we had a lot of fun playing on this table. Hope it last for long.
The table is a perfect combination of price point, quality, and ease of storage. Of those three, storage and quality was the most important. The net is particularly nice and not flimsy. The table, while particle board, seems well constructed and stable (not wobbly like some tables in this price range). Above all, the table halves are easily separated and flipped into two separate upright pieces for easy storage against a garage or basement wall. Or, you can flip up one side and practice hitting against it which is also nice. Overall a great table for the money (I happened to pay 300.00 during Amazon Prime day).
This is an attractive, quality table that I hope will last for many years to come. I am new to table tennis and have young kids I'd like to teach how to play, and was looking for a table that might survive into their teenage years (if taken care of). I think this table was a good choice. While it's very heavy, if you open the box outside and bring each table half in one-at-a-time, you and a friend can likely move it indoors easily. Once it's setup, it's very easy to move the table on its wheels, or set it up as a practice table with one side up. I was also concerned about my basement ceiling height, which is only about 7.5' tall. Competition tables are setup with a ceiling at least 10' about the table (so about 13' ceilings). However, now that I've played a little, I don't imagine every actually needing so much height. If you have a low ceiling like me, get the table anyway. Full disclosure, I received a flyer with my table to receive 12 extra balls if I post a review of any kind on this table.
I had been shopping for an indoor ping-pong table for almost a year. Many I found were either too expensive (for casual recreational use) or became too expensive once shipping was included. Others were less expensive but looked to be of shoddy quality. When this deal became available during Cyber Week, I was ecstatic. The table was delivered on-time, per the agreed upon time, and in good condition. Setup was very easy. The advertisement mentioned it was 90% ready. I didn't believe it, but they weren't kidding. The only setup involved installing the rollers for each half, screwing in the rubber stopper on the bottom of the inner legs, unfolding the table and clipping on the net. I really like the quality of the clips for the net. They seem unlikely to suffer any problems to keep in good working condition. The net hangs looser than I would like, so we'll see in time if we keep this current net solution. The table was flat, smooth, clean and professional looking. The wood is not too thin, but sturdy, and the table neatly folds-up for storage when not being played. From unboxing to playing our first game was 25-30 minutes. The table also came with a coupon for a free set of 3-star balls from Stiga. I'm very satisfied with this purchase. I paid what I wanted to pay for a table and received a better quality new table than I expected to receive for that price.
This table was quite simple to put together. It only took about 30-40 minutes to get everything out of the box and put together. It is very heavy, but once you open up the box the two big table halves are not too bad to work with. Once you get the wheels on and get it upright, it is very easy to move around. Our plan is to have it out in the main basement room most of the time, but in just a couple of minutes, I can get the net off and roll each piece into our storage room if needed. You might (probably not though) find a slightly better deal if you pick it up at a local sporting good store. It is worth it to have it delivered though! And most sporting good sites charge over $100 for delivery, that makes Amazon's deal of free delivery even that much better. The box on this thing said there should be 6 people to lift it! I think 4 could do it without a problem, but that tells you how heavy it is. I'm not even sure this would even fit in all trucks. But again, once you get the box open, the pieces can all be carried by just two people. Overall, this table looks really nice and it plays really well too. I highly recommend it!
Product came in as advertised.  Took probably an hour to assemble total.  I'm a dad of two and have assembled many many items so compared to others this was almost the easiest.  If you have never assembled anything in your life and have never read schematic plans.....yes it might be a little more difficult for you - but you'd still be able to do it.  Toughest part was carrying it to the basement.  It is fairly heavy and awkward, definitely need 2 people to position it where you will be assembling.  Basically all you are doing is putting together the wheel assembly and that is it.  The table actually comes in 2 unattached halves - which seems odd at first but performs just fine.  The foldability and movability are great - really gives you the advantage of using your space better.  I have read a few of the other negative reviews and understand where they are coming from.  Yes this was made in China and I too have ordered things and they have not come in as expected with pieces missing or something attached incorrectly - that can be incredibly frustrating.  Unfortunately these are all assembled in some mass produced factory and humans are humans.....they have bad days too.  Love the table - would order again if we ever have the need for a second ping pong table.
I looked at an old used table that was originally priced really high. But after comparing it to this one, it was way better to go with the new one! This table is performing well at our church and is used a ton. I will probably have to buy another one here soon!
This table shipped packaged really well, it came on a pallet very well secured. It is heavy, so takes at least two people to unpackage it and get it where it needs to go. We had no issues putting it together, and now that it is it's very simple to fold it up and roll it out of the way. It's very mobile when folded and stays locked up nicely. The table is large, but when it folds up it's not overly tall because of where the joint is. It's also nice to be able to fold it up and move it out of the way to clean the floor beneath it. We've had multiple people playing on the table and everyone has enjoyed it. The net is easy to clip on and take off (if you have pets you don't want messing with the net when you aren't playing) and the only seam on the table is under the net, so we haven't had any issues with it messing up play. The balls and paddles are decent quality, nothing amazing, but good enough to play for fun. This was a great purchase and has given us many hours of fun.
We have had this the Lite table now for about 2 weeks. It is in our finished basement. The weather has been super hot and this has been the perfect respite for teenagers and their friends indoors. Our whole family has played together too! The delivery and set-up went smoothly, table is great and easy to use and maneuver! So glad we finally did this, we should have gotten one sooner! You can't go wrong with this STIGA table!!
I was admittedly skeptical when I heard that this was 95% completely assembled upon receipt... but truly, it took me about 20 minutes to get it completely set up. It is great quality, and takes about 3 minutes to fold and move. The only caveat I would offer is that you want to make sure you have sufficient space in the room that you have this in to play the game.. My room is 16' x 15', and it works for me to have full range with the pool table running diagonal.
I bought this because it was on a super 60% off sale on Amazon. I am not unhappy but I have to say that this is not as great as I thought it would be. It is perfectly fine for what it is but it is a lite table so a bit lighter in construction. But still well made. What really surprised me was that the two halves dont secure together. There are just two separate tables that you push next to each other, then you clip them together with the net holder. The two tables dont actually secure to each other so a strong bump will probably separate them. Its fine but just surprising. Otherwise, a nice table. Took about 30-45 minutes to put four feet on. Not a big deal.
One thing I worried about shipping a large item was damage. While the box did have signs of damage, it was well packed inside. I had ordered other tables in the past where that was not the case and always had to return them. As others have said, the way the box of wheels is packed against one of the sides and does cause some scrapes, but it's on the bottom of the table and has no adverse effect. The table is really nice looking, nice color and smooth. It folds up and rolls around super easily. It appears very sturdy and well made. My family and I are only recreational players, but I wanted to get something at least one tier up from the most budget of tables. So far we're all loving it. We'll see if it stands the test of time.
Overall, great table for pros and amateurs.  The table top is solid 5/8 so consistent and uniformed bounce. The color is a lighter blue and contrasts very nice with the bright white stripe. The net is one of best features as it is spring loaded and with enough torque that it ensures the two sides are uniform and stay together. The red advantage accent adds a nice sporty look to it. The one area that I only have 4 stars was that it was missing 4 washers. It supposed to come with 16 per instructions so we had to compromise with other stainless steel washers vs the black that comes with the table.
I did a decent amount of research on tables before pulling the trigger on this STIGA, and am really happy with my choice. The packing materials were pretty impressive, keeping the surface pristine during shipping. There were a few nicks on the underside of the table, but nothing that affects form or function. I was _almost_ able to assemble the table by myself, but needed a hand when flipping the two halves over. Everyone I've had over comments on what a sweet table this is, and we've been having a blast with it. Folding it up is easy and smooth. My research  led me to believe this table would high quality and great value - definitely the case so far!
The box seemed really small when received! There was very little assembly (wheels only), that took about 20 minutes to unpack and flip over. I had read that other models took hours to assemble the screws. Then you manuever the two halves together and quickly clip on the net. Remember this unit does not come with paddles or balls.
We received this three months ago. It was delivered with no packaging problems at all. We opened it up to carry the pieces down the basement steps to make it lighter and more maneuverable. All pieces were there with no damage. It assembled very quickly without any problems. Got it up and ready to go. We played this daily for at least a month after receiving it and are down to a couple times a week after the "new" wore off. We never had any problem with the playing surface or the net. I have yet to raise one side up and try it single player as my kids are always up for a game if I ask. Overall, I have zero complaints about this table. It is great quality at a great piece and my family gives it an enthusiastic 5 stars.
From delivery to setup, this was a wonderful purchase! The packing of the table (2 halves with 2 extra boxes for net and caster sections) seemed very secure. There were 1/2 thick MDF pieces on all four edges just for safety while shipping, which was helpful since there was some damage to an edge of the box. Table surface is beautiful! Ease of moving the table into place including the clamp net is so nice. When attaching caster sections, attach half of bracket first. This makes it much easier. So excited for many years of family and friends enjoying this table! Thank you, Stiga!
I ordered this table thinking it would be delivered into my home, as you would do with a piece of furniture!  I asked the delivery men to bring the table into my home. The delivery men told me no and left the table in my garage.  It is too heavy too move!  It will cost me more money to have it moved into the room.  How can I possibly put this in place???? I AM VERY DISSATISFIED WITH HOW THIS WAS HANDLED!!!!
Order and in about a week Amazon scheduled the delivery with a carrier. Got it in less than 2 weeks. The box itself is pretty heavy -  Close to 200lb so you need another person to move it around before you unbox it. Really easy setup - less than 15 minutes with two people. Technically you can do it with one person if you are strong enough but easier with two to flip each side of the table. Table wobbles a little as it has wheels but its not a big deal. Its not a pro table but its perfect for advanced recreational and club practice!
This is a high-quality table that provides high value. We are not table tennis experts, but this is a great investment in family fun with opportunity to become a very seasoned player.  Amazon delivery was excellent, taking good care to place the box in our garage; my only wish would have been some help to get this down the stairs to the basement. The box is too bulky and heavy for one person to do, so we took it down in parts and assembled it. Assembly was simple; just need a couple of wrenches to add the 4 caster segments. Very fast assembly, and once assembled, its easy to turn over. Thereafter, hours of fun! Folding for storage is easy, and when folded the table is very stable and locks in position and trucks out of the way. Its also very easy to move when folded, and can be used in a play-back position.  Again, great value, high- quality definitely go with 2 pieces and minimum assembly!
I have been looking for a ping pong table for several months.  I was looking for a mid-level quality table (new or used).  It would be for my home as recreational use.  I have been watching items in auction sites and local sales listing.  However, buying used items was a challenge as I dont have a truck or van to pickup the item. Eventually, I decided to buy from Amazon because of the reputation and ease of delivery (even large items). Buying experience: * Quick delivery schedule (even without Prime) - the order was placed on Saturday, and the delivery was possible on the following Thursday (5 days!). * Scheduled delivery is a really great option (for large items especially). * I opted to purchase the used item (in very good condition) to save few bucks.  It arrived with some minor scratches on the bottom and box.  However, the playing surface was perfect. Assembly: * Assembly of the leg with caster was easy and took less than 30 minutes. * It does require that you be able to lift pretty heavy object as each table piece can weigh a good 50 lbs or more.  It would be good to have a helper. * Be very careful not to over-tighten the bolts.  As someone mentioned in other reviews, stop when you see the plastic washer start to deform. * Assembly overall is a straight forward process. Table quality and playability: * The table feels very solid. * The surface is very smooth with vivid lines. * The bounce is also very good. * The supplied net is very good quality that provides great tension.  I love it that it installs in seconds using spring loaded clamp. * Overall, very satisfied with the table.
Arrived damaged
We got a great deal on this table while it was a deal of the day.  It is a great table that plays like a much more expensive table.  The reason that I love this table so much is the way it folds and stores.  it it were not for this option we could not have a ping pong table.  Stiga has always been the leader when it comes to ping pong.
Table arrived today and I had it assembled in a short amount of time!  The net is really nice, set up is awesome and easy!  Very sharp looking!!  One of the plastic corner pieces was slightly damaged and sticks out some because it's glued on at the factory.  No replacement from manufacturer available.  Will have to figure out how to protect without players getting snagged by it and making it worse as it gets used.  They did a nice job packing and protecting.  Even the shipping company(s) did well with minimal marks/damage to the box it came in.  Four and a half stars only because of corner issue -- otherwise 5 stars!
Good quality table at a good price. It was easy to install/assemble. Net assembly is also very good. Look, color and material also surpassed my expectations. Would definitely recommend it.
After reading many reviews, I ended up buying the STIGA Pro. And I was so happy I did. The shipping was as promised. The guys were professional and careful. The ping pong table arrived on the day and the range of time as promised. It was well packed, and the table had no bumps or bruises. The set-up was very easy and I would agree that having two people to help with the set-up is the best way to go. The net is great but should come with a set of instructions (although it is intuitive how to install). I have no complaints and would make the same buying decision based upon the entire experience and seeing the product in person. Let the games begin :)
I was in market for long time for the indoor TT as I broke the first one while assembling. This is one of the best I have seen so far.  It took me total 25 mins from unwrapping to all the way assembling the entire table. it also easy to move around due to wheels and looks very sturdy and high quality. My kids are now playing everyday. I would recommend this to everyone who is looking for indoor Table Tennis
Super easy to assemble - everything is done, except screwing the wheels to the pole (= 4 x 2 screws). Each half of the table remains independent from the other and are the net clamps them together. Wheels are on the smaller size, which is not ideal to move on a uneven surface; also as it's basically 2 tables you need to move each half table whenever storing / using it ! Good buy...
This is by far the best ping pong table in this price range. Easy to assemble. The product details tell you that the table is 95% assembled which is actually true. The only trouble I had was I didnt have a wrench to tighten the nuts and bolts and it doesnt come with the table. So make sure you have it handy. The actual assembly time was less than 30 minutes. The tables says lite but it is sturdy enough for you to play a real ping-pong game. Easy to move as well. I have this placed in my garage. My wife and I are having a great time playing a few games after coming back from work. Loved this product and definitely a great buy.
Item was sent on time. It was already almost completely  preassembled, all needed to be done was the wheels to be placed on the legs which was very easy and took about 10 minutes for one person to do. The quality appears to be very good and played very well. The color coating on the table looked uniform and very nice.
The product delivery folks were really helpful, and were accommodating. They maneuvered the tight office space and got the package delivered without any issues. On opening the package, I noticed some scratches (on the non-playing surface). However, with a little paint touch up, the table looked good. Assembling was not that difficult, but a little time consuming. I recommend to have additional helper, if possible. The bounce quality is good, and for most beginners and intermediate players, this  is a good buy. The quality of the product shows (very well made). I wish they had included a starter set for players (perhaps, 2 paddles and 2 balls).
Great table.Solid/sturdy in every way. Easy to set up - box to playing in 15-20 mins. Love the bounce of the surface, it plays like a pro table costing much much more. Great net set, too. Though the net directions need some work. One change I would suggest: Stiga should add better corner protections, we added some 3m ones we found, but it would be a nice touch.
My biggest concern in purchasing my Stiga table was whether I could get it downstairs.  No problem!  I took it out of the box and the table with the legs was only a couple inches thick.  That meant only a slight tip of each of the 4 1/2 X 5 foot tables as we went downstairs.  Then I put it together downstairs without any issues.  It was easy and quick to assemble.  No missing parts and the table was in perfect shape.  I love the net system Stiga uses. When putting on the net the clamps helped to pinch the table together and to slightly level the two halves of the table.  I put the table on carpet and was glad to have the 4 leveling wheels on the table to level both halves.  Now comes the fun part: table tennis with friends!
Good price for a recreational family sport and it is a big table which my son likes.  It folds up small for rolling away into storage area and freeing up space for party or big sleep over.  For the price I recommend it but if you are a serious player, may want to get a more professional table.
Take delivered in time with really good packing. But the product itself is looking a used one rather than new one. The wheels looked good but the nuts, bolts came in a single packing which looks like a refurbished or used item. Frustrated with the product. Hated it so much have to return it. The paint finish is very bad and is rough. There are multiple cracks and the wood work is very rough.
This pingpong table is at very good quality at reasonable price.  I used to play pingpong on outdoor pingpong table.  When I purchased this table, and I find myself it is really much better than my outdoor's ones.  The ball bounced on this table at regular hight.  I have very good playing experience at playing pingpong on it.  Our family all like the table very much. They said I might received 6 sitga balls from them if I wrote a review about this purchase posted here.  Yes, I did it, but they did not mail any balls to my address.
Nice looking, quality table in this price range .I'm not close to pro but I like to play. Adjustable legs ensure that the two halves of the table meet perfectly. Net set-up is easy. Rolls easily. Carton to play-ready took about 45 minutes by myself (although that's not recommended by Stiga because the table is heavy). Amazon delivery was great.
We love our ping pong table: it's sturdy, easy to fold, and fun to play with. We purchased during a lightning deal, and we are happy with the quality and price. One thing to be aware of is that this ships in one box. Fortunately, the freight company that delivered our table was kind enough to carry it in via our basement steps, but it almost didn't clear the doorway because of the steps. The box is nearly 200 pounds, so I'm not sure what I would have done had they not been willing to carry it inside. The table is packed well, though. The table arrived in great condition, and we had no difficulty with the minimal assembly required.
I was a little concerned that the table would be too large to get down the stairs to our basement, but it was a breeze. We opened the box, and the table comes in 2 large sections. While heavy, they fit easily down the stairs and around the banister into the room. Setup was also very easy. My 15 year old son and I were able to get everything completed in 15 minutes. The table is very sturdy and provides excellent  game play. Note: It does not come with paddles or balls, so you need to order those separately.
It literally took me 12 minutes to assemble it.  Its a high quality table and I love it.  Plays awesome!
Received the table yesterday. Was concerned because the box arrived with holes in the side. After unpacking, the cross support on one side of the table leg STIGA Advantage Indoor Table Tennis Table was slightly bent. Decided to go ahead and assemble to see if there were any other damages. The table was very easy to finish assembly. The bend in the cross support does not seem to effect the function of the table. Very happy with the table. Unhappy with the fact that so far I have not been able to win a game against my wife.
In the package I received, five out of seven small parts are missing. I emailed/called manufacture on June 27 to get the missing parts. However, I still have not received the parts yet. Update on July 15, I received the H1, H2, and H3 parts. However, I still have not received the P2 and P3 parts.
This first table we got the leg leveler is broken, so on side of the table is unbalance. We did the replacement, however, it is a big project to reassemble and put it back to the cardboard box. It is more than 200 pounds. Because it has quality issue, it is super unconvinced for us. We also called the manufacturer, they shipped printer and another leg leveler to us. We can our replacement table on Thursday. The second one is much more better. Overall, the playability is good. Quality is good for this price. We liked its overlook. And the assembly is easy.
We bought this table to upgrade a used one we got from Craigslist and had a bow. This table is sweet! Easy installation, feels sturdy and well made. super easy folding and moving even for my 112lb wife. nice finish and bounce. We are not pros but for home use this works. nice net, too, very strong clamps which hold the two sides together. fold one half for training mode. :) color is light blue, pleasant and subdued but happy. wheels are strong and smooth and lock to prevent movement. Good job Stiga!
This is an incredible table to have as an amateur player, but one who wants quality!  It is a marked difference from the cheap table we had been playing on.  And the customer service was PHENOMENAL.  The net came with a hole in it, and it was IMMEDIATELY replaced for us.  The set up for the table was super easy, which is such an added plus.  Before we bought this table we had been trying to get a used STIGA off of craigslist, but honestly, it was so much nicer having it delivered right to our door.  I would totally recommend this table.
The Pre-assembly on this table is a humongous help.  It does take two people however to do it right, as you want to be careful handling the separate halves of the table and not scratch the playing surface.  The only "assembly" is attaching 4 sets of wheels to the inside legs.  There are 4 reinforced cardboard strips that look like 2x4's that are used to stabilize the box - these are perfect for setting the table onto while doing the leg attachments and leaving the playing surface pristine.  Very happy with this purchase, extremely high quality table, and it folds away very compact.
Was as described, 8 bolts to attach legs with was so easy!! Paid a little extra to have 2 people place in basement. Box it came in was very torn up so they cut the rest open to make sure no damage and made it easier to take the 2 pieces into basement. No damage and no scratches. Highly recommend!!
Finally got around to putting together this ping pong table after ordering in before Christmas. I delayed doing it because I thought I would need a lot of help assembling it and getting in ready to play on.  Boy was I mistaken.  It was a breeze to set up!. I did need my 15 yr old son's help only twice, to lay down the two sides face down to install the preassembled legs/wheels and again to flip each side right-side up. It's as simple as installing and tightening 8 bolts with a socket wrench and clipping on the net...that's it!  Very high quality table,and I didn't even have to adjust the legs to make the two sides level with each other.  Highly recommend this table.
We received the table in very good condition. It was well packed and arrived on time .We were allowed to choose the time of delivery and were also given a call before the delivery which was very helpful. The assembly of the table was very easy. The quality of the table is extremely good and the wheels and legs of the table are very sturdy. I have played on tournament boards and this one is a really cool table to have at home. Truly worth it !!
We are very happy with this ping pong table. It seems well built and assembly was very easy... Just had to install the casters.
Easy set up and fun to play on. The ping pong table looks nice, and is really solid, heavy and sturdy.  It's also quite simple to fold and put away. We've been playing since we assembled the table! Delivery was on time. The packaging is solid and extremely heavy, so make sure you have them deliver it to an open area where you'll have space to maneuver. Kids STIGA Advantage Competition-Ready Indoor Table Tennis Table 95% Preassembled Out of the Box with Easy Attach and Remove Net are enjoying competing! Overall, extremely happy with the purchase. I'd absolutely recommend buying this table specifically, but get it online.
The table comes almost completely assembled, and the only thing you really have to do is to assemble the rolling feet on the bottom of the table. With basically just two wrenches i was able to assemble the rest of the table in about 15 minutes. The rolling feet of the table also work phenomenally, and they roll very smoothly on our hard wood floor. The table feels great and the net it comes with works well. Very good purchase and definitely worth the price.
The table arrived right on time. The delivery service called in advance and the morning of. The box that it came in protects the table really well. My 16 year old daughter and I put the legs on with the wheels in about 30 minutes. Because the table is heavy, it took 2 people. However, the directions and process were really easy. My family loves this table and were so surprised that I could get it quickly and at such a great price. My son, who has researched tables, was so impressed that we got a STIGA. Solidly made and looks good too. And with the wheels it is easy to move around.
This is a great table for the price. Delivery was easy, it arrived without any damage. Set up was a breeze in about 15 minutes.  It has a great bounce, easy to break down and store in tiny space.  Really phenomenal even at twice the price.
This is a nice table, works well.  I like that it is two pieces.  I find it very easy to fold and "put away."  The advertisement that it is 90% assembled is accurate.  You just have to attached 8 bolts on the legs to put the wheels on--fairly easy. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the first table was delivered damaged.  One of the corners was broken.  A simple chat with Amazon and a new one was ordered--which did mean another 3 hour window when I had to be home for the delivery and waiting 10 more days to get my table.
The best balls are three star but the table is five stars, easy to assemble, great to play on. If you are making a long term investment in your family and home do not get less than the best and this table is it. It is really a piece of furniture as well as a source of great recreation and pleasure. The included nuts were tough to use so we did run to our hardware store for replacements.
We set our table up in the garage over a month ago and we have played multiple hours out there with the kids and our friends!  So much fun!! I haven't tried folding it yet for storage, but I can speak on behalf of all other aspects that it's a great table so far! Can't wait to use it during our Superbowl party where it will get the most use out of it yet! :-)
Very good ping pong table. With right tool I can assemble it alone within 30 minutes. It was delivered fast with no quality issue. I was worried about the quality since its gonna be hard to return such a heavy item. Lucky I dont have this problem. My wife and I have played days on it. Good experience on this order
My husband bought this for the kids to use while at home during quarantine.  Little did we know how much fun the adults in the house would have playing.  We keep it in the garage, but could easily be kept in a game room.  It is very sturdy and easy to put one side up for one person to practice.
We've been playing almost daily for three months on the Stiga Advantage and can honestly say it's a great table at a great price! Easy to follow assembly directions and table design meant we were up and playing in no time.  The table is really high quality, from the surface to the professional net setup to the supporting structure. It folds up and away in no time if need be, and quickly converts to single player practice with a flip up of one side. We recommend this table!
Great Table Tennis table! I was impressed by the Amazon reviews for this table, which helped make my decision to purchase. After receiving the unit I was thoroughly blown away by the quality of this table. Everything from the leg design, quality of workmanship, top paint to how the product was packed for shipping. All TOP NOTCH and with a great eye for quality. I particularly like the way the two table tops separate and fold upright for storage.  Clean and perfectly designed. If you are on the fence between two brands, you honestly can NOT go wrong with this table!
This is really good product but I have received the table with manufacturers mistakes. One of the wheel has wrong holes for screws and it looks weird. I can still use it but the wheel leg coming out hits my legs every time when we play so we have to be careful not to get hurt.
Very nice table for the price. It has a good solid feel and weight. It took only 10 minutes to unfold the legs and screw in the wheels. Box was very heavy because the table was packed well with hard cardboard to prevent damage during shipping. It took 2 big men to deliver it and place it in our house hallway. We took the pieces out of the box one by one to move it downstairs to the basement. Very happy with it!
I know you can pay a lot more than this for a new ping pong table, so I was really happy to find this one to be so high quality for a reasonable price. The box it came in took two guys to carry, but once we got it in the garage it was pretty easy to assemble and my boyfriend and I were playing ping pong in less than an hour. I really like the clip-on net, it's so much easier and faster than our old screw on one. Overall it's a nice table, fairly simple but a huge upgrade from our old one.
What can I say.....my family and I love this table.  The day we got it delivered we were a little nervous about how much was involved in putting it together.  After opening the box and reading the instructions, we were relieved. The table is basically already complete. There are just a few minor parts to put together.  We were playing on the table within 20 mins of opening the box.  The build quality is top notch!  This table has already been a hit at a couple holiday parties that we have hosted.  I definelty recommend this table to anyone looking for a high quality, affordable, ping pong table!
This is a great table. Delivery was a snap.  Shipping company called and delivered it exactly as promised. Easy to assemble- two table halves- add wheel assemblies- flip it over- snap on net- we were playing in less than 30 minutes from delivery High quality surface- great action- nice looking. In 2 minutes it folds up and wheels away into my storage area Buy this table if you want an great playing, easy to assemble and portable table!
Really nice pingpong table. You can't beat it for the price. I bought mine on prime day and got 20% off new which came out cheaper than the used when I have been watching. It's a really strange design though because the two halves don't physically connect... You just put them against each other after you have attached the casters and wheels and use the net to clamp them together on each side. The net itself is very strong and really good quality. Make sure that you have a nice flat floor for this that is Tile or carpet... It folds up really easily... And it is actually quite stylish. Also, the table is not as bouncy as a more professional table so it requires a little more effort but it's totally cool. For the price, definitely worth it and looks great.
After checking a few sites comparing the best table for the money I decided on the STIGA Advantage. I was not disappointed with this great table. It's a very solid table that looks great and can easily be moved around for storage. It was a breeze to setup with me only have to add the wheel brackets. I would recommend this table to anybody who's on a budget like myself but still wants a high quality table. Plays good and looks great!
I am an average ping pong player who enjoys the occasional game with friends and family. I previously owned a Stiga table and was impressed with it's quality and durability. That table lasted for about ten years before it broke down. So after doing research on ping pong tables, I believed that the Stiga Advantage was the table for me. The assembly of the table was easy. Being a person that is not very good at building things, this table took me and a friend around 30 minutes to build. It is also easy store away and set up. The quality of the table is pretty good. Although I'm pretty sure it won't meet the standard of competitive and professional players, but for the average Joe it is solid. The table is solidly built and is basically two table pieces joined by two clamps that hold the net. I wouldn't say the surface of the table is tournament standard, but it is good enough for casual and amateur players. Overall all I say that this is a solid table, (keep in mind I'm a casual player). The assembly is easy and straight forward, the quality is great, which enhances the playability of the table. This is definitely worth the $400 investment in my opinion.
I'm a beginner player but it seems like a great table for the price. The table did come with a big ding in one center corner but we decided it wouldn't affect playability, being right up against the net. I suggest carefully inspecting table before you sign off on it. I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning. Perhaps manufacturer needs to pad corners a little better. Table is well built and we are so glad we took the plunge!
Its really not super hard to assemble but there are no instructions. You have to YouTube some random dude figuring it out since he didnt get instructions either. This models instructions are not on the manufacturers website either. Hindsight, you can figure it out yourself but really how hard would even a single page printout be? Also there isnt really a way to lock the two sides together. Havent had any issues yet with the clamps and wheel locks but Id even pay extra for the option.
Delivered in perfect condition by 2 men who took it into the basement for us.  Easy to put together with casters onto  legs , then 2 people turn  it over, slide together and net clamps on to hold table sturdy in one piece. Beautiful playing surface with great bounce.
Item arrived and was packed well very little  assembly was required however imagine my surprise on discovered that two of the folding brackets for the legs were installed backwards. Fortunately I am very good with tools and working things out so I was able to correct in about 15 min once I worked out the problem. If you are not a tool person or good DIY type you may have been returning it
I purchased an Amazon Warehouse return for a slight discount. The price value of this model seems better than the Joola tables. The table arrived without any damage and assembled easily. The surface is not as thick as I would like but that's what we get at this price point. No complaints.
When we were shopping for indoor table tennis table, easy to assemble and easy to fold was our criteria. This table just fits the bill! Highly recommend this one!
This table is heavy and very well made.  It was packaged well and arrived in perfect condition.  Folding the table up and stowing it away takes seconds.  The net and 3/4" top are great quality.  We've had countless hours of fun with this and due to its rugged build will last a very long time.
Bought the table for our grandkids and it works great. Did not give 5 stars because of problems with the shipment. Purchased the additional support to have the table delivered to the basement, but the person delivering the product needed a second person to help with the movement. He offered to call his shop to have a second person come, but I did not want to wait, so I volunteered to help. Additional problem was the condition of the table - it had probably been dropped during shipment because many of the screws holding the frame to the table top were loose, and one was completely out of place. I had to try to tighten them all but several would not hold very firmly because they had been pulled from the MDF material. I did the best I could, and when the table was assembled the table top rests on the frame so there appears to be no structural problems, but it should not have happened. Other than those problems, the table works just as intended, and I believe we will be getting years of good use from this product.
Great quality for the price. Even the net is above average. Easy assembly right out of the box. Just four wheel attachments, flip it over, clamp on the net and you're ready to play. Took about 20 minutes by myself to have it up and ready to play. It's a solid table and great for home entertainment. Keep it out of the sun and it should last a long time. Does not come with paddles/balls, you will have to order those separately. Highly recommend.
Well-made and extremely sturdy ping-pong table. Highly recommend this table. Basically comes preassembled ready to use right out of the box. Couldnt believe how simple it was to set up. Extremely well-made
This table was easy to put together. It took me 20 minutes. more time spent up packing it, LOL. We bought for the garage for my girls to play.  the table is really, really good quality, you only attach the wheels and stand it up.. pretty darn easy. And... I won the first game against my 10 year old who hates to lose, so "winner, winner.. chicken dinner" as I like to rub it in her face!!! great table.
This is a very nice table for the price. If you are not practicing to be a professional and want a table to have fun around the house, this is a great table. The quality is top notch with minor complaints: I do wish that the lock bars were a little more robust but they do the trick. The top of the table came out of the box clean but I did notice a couple of gash marks on the bottom of the table. Nothing worth crying about but it did make me a little sad knowing I bought a brand new table so that I could avoid scratches and dings. Assembly was easy. Took me about 45 minutes alone. I was half asleep so one could probably set it up in 30 minutes alone if on top of their game. This table is very sturdy and you really can't go wrong for the $399 price tag. Buy it. Sell your dinning room table. Replace dinning room table with table tennis table. Best decision I ever made.
The problem I encountered with the table when setting it up was that the metal reinforcing bars at the ends and sides had several screws that were loose.  There were four total (two at each end) at the end metal bars of the table that were sticking out at an angle.  I would not have noticed the other screws being lose if I had not observed the ones sticking up.  I went all around the table with my Philips screwdriver to make sure they were seated.  I tried to screw them back in, but they would not take hold of the particle board so I had to drill new holes adjacent into the metal reinforcement piece next to the original ones.  There were approximate five screws that would not tighten down plus the four at the ends that were actually sticking out.  Other than that being a pain in the neck the table was an easy set up.
From start to end an easy set up. It's heavy, so you might want a friend to help out. The table itself is solid construction, and easily assembled (maybe 10 minutes?). It's easy to level, and the net goes on securely. All-in-all a good design. Four stars only because we have not had a chance to use it in any serious way - will comment again if things change. You'll be happy with this. But: it's BIG. Make sure you have the room for it.
I will never be more satisfied with this purchase of mine. This is perfect as product is easy to install and delivered on time. No complaints. Never thought how smooth this purchase was, as from other places where they charge you 200 for shipping heavy item. Amazon rocks.
Just received my Stiga Advatange Table Tennis table and I could not be more pleased.  The table was delivered as promised on the day and timeframe that I requested during purchase.  The delivery team was very professional and brought the package into my home. Unpacking and set up was a breeze and very straight forward.  All I needed to add where some wrenches and I was able to set it up in less than a half hour.  I did require the assistance of a second pair of hand, mainly to flip the table after putting together the legs/wheels. Once the table was turned over, it was extremely easy to move around place within the room where I wanted it.  The net set up in no time and the levelers on the legs allowed the table to be perfectly level. The table has a nice clean look and feels very professional.  The materials seem to be of a very high quality and the table is very sturdy. I have already a ton of fun playing with my family and the playability has been everything I hoped for. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this table highly.
I don't write a lot of reviews on items that I purchase, however this product deserves it. I had went through about 20 reviews before I purchased this product. My main concern was setup time, and I didn't want to pay someone to set it up. My 6th grader and his friend set this table up in about 30 minutes. I used my muscles to move the table around and tighten a few bolts.  From cradle to grave setup time from out of box to playing a game was about 45 minutes.  Heavy duty ping pong table that really exceeded my expectations. Thanks Stiga!
Extremely superior material and quality. I had read a lot of reviews on various Table Tennis tables before buying this...since $400 was not a small amount to invest (given that I am an amateur player). I have to say that this table exceeded all my expectations on all fronts. The most amazing feature for me was the way the balancing works when you fold the table to the vertical position (either for storage or practice play). The transition from normal play position to the vertical position is so effortless that my 8 year old can do it without any help from me.This is my first STIGA purchase and I am sticking with this company for sure. Two thumbs up and highly recommend to anyone who is in a dilemma of choosing the right Table Tennis table. Go for STIGA...trust me, you won't repent !!!
This has been a great addition to my families play room. The product was easy to install and took me less than 15 min by myself. I really like the color of the table as well. The only reason I didnt rate at 5 starts is the net that comes with it. the standard net does droop a bit and it constantly moving (the clamps move). So, I ordered a different Stiga net that can tighten for $24 on Amazon and am very happy with it.
Just got this for Christmas. Delivery was very smooth with freight. One corner had a little ding in it but otherwise fine.  Got it setup in about 10 minutes (8 bolts and a clip-on net) and we were up and running.  The table is really good looking...I love the blue surface. My 9 y/o can easily fold half up for single person play.  Seems to be a great quality table that I look forward to using for years to come.
We are beginners, and enjoying it so far. It's been almost a month since our purchase and we play almost daily at home (indoors). Need two adults during assembly to flip the table. And easier to move with two adults holding it. It's a full size table. Ensure you have additional room space to move around during game play.
Little nervous about the delivery of this table but turns out it was unnecessary worry. The delivery couldnt have been easier. The driver and helper brought this baby down our steep bank to the basement and then opened it up and took all the packing materials with them. Couldnt ask for better service. As for the table itself, set up was a breeze. Took no time at all to attach the wheels. The color is a soothing shade of blue, nothing too bright or flashy. And the best part is we are having so much fun playing. The table did not disappoint in performance. We couldnt be happier with this purchase.
I hemmed and hawed about whether I should be spending more for a higher quality model and im glad I didnt. This table is great for our basement playroom. High quality, sturdy. Assembled solo. Maybe a thicker table would be better if you were a pro, but this was a great purchase for my home.
This table is great! The quality and price is unbeatable. I also got it with free shipping. Super easy to put together and set up. When folded, it's super thin and easy to store. One this to watch out for is that this table is quite heavy (this is another sign of great quality). Be careful when unboxing. Make sure you have enough space for the initial assemble. Once it's assembled, you should have no problem rolling it around.
I like everything about this purchase.  The ping pong table was delivered as planned.  The quality of the product is excellent.  There was only simple minor assembly required.  Easy setup and take down.  Stores nicely.  Best of all I was able to purchase as a great price as an Amazon Daily Deal.
The quality of the pro table appears to be excellent.  Assembly was easy (about 30mins with a small wrench and socket driver.) Delivery was on time, friendly and  no problem although the driver told me that some can be harder than others!  The table is heavy so you will need help moving the box and flipping over the table once you attach the casters.  Once assembled moving the table on the larger caster of the pro table is a breeze.  I have not played on the table yet but will be looking faorward to many family games Christmas afternoon and beyond!
We received this table a week after Christmas in perfect condition. My family has been using it a lot. Its helped bring our family a little closer to one another instead of wasting time staring at screens! We set ours up in the garage where Ive installed a space heater. We go out to play almost daily! Now if only I can get good enough to beat my wife all would be right in the world!!
As others have noted, setup was fast and easy for the two of us. While I don't have much to compare it to, the quality is what I expected from Stiga - that is to say excellent all around. The wheels lock into place easily enough, and the net is fantastic and easier to manage than any other I have tried before. If you're looking for a no-fuss table that gets the job done, this worked for me. Like amateurs we measured everything from the table height, width, and even the height the balls bounce off the table. Everything checks out.
We unfold and fold this up every day, and it is super easy.  It was not difficult to assemble--it's heavy in the box, so make sure you have a couple people around.  High quality table.
We have bought this table for a few months.  There were a few small parts missing when we received the package. After contacting the seller, they mailed the missed parts to us in the same week.  I appreciate their conscientiousness and efficiency. The tennis table is perfect, we enjoy it.
Very good table, overall.  Color is more of a deep green-blue rather than the blue seen in the picture.  Having put together a 4-piece table in the past, I really liked the 10 minute set up with this 2-piece table.  I also like the fact that the table is easy to fold up and store. It would be nice if the table included a set of paddles and a ball.
We debated between Advantage or Advantage Lite, ended up going with the Lite so it would be easier to move when not in use. Very happy with the quality and weight of it. Easy to assemble, easy to move, perfectly sturdy for play, looks great. It was delivered quickly and efficiently. Very happy with the purchase
It is heavy, so initial movement of delivery box requires help. Assembly took 10 minutes with the help of some students. We rolled it outside (maybe 300 yards) to use at a school carnival. Two people moved it easily. It is now the pride and joy of the Ping Pong club.
This is a very good table.  The 18mm surface gives a good quality bounce, the height adjusters allow for a level surface, the surface texture/finish is very good, the net attaches easily and holds good tension, and it can be easily moved or maneuvered by just one person. Assembly is pretty simple but you will need a second person when flipping over each half of the table. I paid extra for the delivery team to bring it into our house and down the stairs to our basement.  Definitely give that some thought when ordering.
It is HEAVY so when it is delivered, get some help moving it into your home.  You will need to attach the wheels and then lift it into place.  It comes in two halves and you will place it on its top to attach the legs.  Have a large clean space to do this.  Then get help to turn it upright and do the other side.  The two sides do not attach together, but the net clamps between the two and seems to hold it all in place.  I keep one side folded up when two people aren't playing so I can go pound a few by myself, but it is so easy to raise and lower it is not really necessary.
This table is fantastic quality and very heavy! The color is nice without being too bright/much. It was easy to put together and could be done solo but it was easier having a second person. You will absolutely need a second person to flip it over. There was a delivery upgrade (paid) option to have them place it in the room of your choice - DO THIS! We did not, thinking "how heavy could it be?". Spoiler alert - ITS HEAVY. My only quip is that there's no connection between the two havles under the table. I did not realize this from the pictures and don't remember reading a review that mentioned it. The only thing "connecting" the two sides of the table is the clip for the net. So far this hasn't been an issue for us but if you ever want to fold or move the table, you have to move the net and then move each side individually.
Absolutely love this table. I have two complaints tho - - My piece had one wheel broken (The locking part). My fault that I forgot to email them for a replacement but still, I would not expect a wheel to be broken when I buy a new piece. However, have not deducted a star for that. - The resale value is average. I am moving out now and I am selling this, after 6 months, along with 4 paddles (for free) and I am only getting about 280 for it (Mine was 440 with tax plus 50 for paddles). All the other request we got for the table was for $200 or less for table with paddles. The table is in extremely new condition but people are still not willing to buy it at a higher price.
FYI, Writing a review on amazon gives you 12 Stiga 3 star balls after purchasing, so I think there's a bias here towards 5 star reviews. But that said, you get an excellent quality ping pong table for a very reasonable price. The packaging is very well thought out, and has excellent protection for the edges of the table, particularly the corners. The table itself is very heavy and durable appearing. The net implementation is pretty solid. It's not very obvious but the end of 4 table legs do have adjustable height circular feet which was needed for an indoor on top of rug install. I love the blue color over the dark green and black tables out there. The table does not scratch very easily either. Assembly was relatively quick (10 minutes) and the only issue is that the screws don't entirely fit well, so to get the parts to fit tightly you do need two wrenches and some average strength. The only design issue is that the two halves the table have only the clamp for the net holding the two halves together, so lunging for a short ball during a game could require some readjustment of the table. That said, the table is very heavy/durable so it won't normally be an issue unless a lot of force is driven into the table. Lastly, the scheduled delivery of the table is done through a contracted service that apparently is not amazon (KPO). Expect phone calls before the delivery and after the delivery to notify you of the planned time of delivery, as well as request for a satisfaction survey. The delivery was 5 stars. They called 30 min before arrival. They arrived within the 3 hr window promised. They even helped move the very heavy box to the basement for us.
Our Stiga table tennis table was delivered through Amazons service that will place the item where you want it and given the weight of the table, our desire to have it on our lower level our physical limitations and the very reasonable price for the service it was a good choice.  The table delivery was coordinated ahead of time and delivered professionally and on time.  The table was packaged better than just about any product we have received through mail order and sustained no damage in shipment.  It was easy to assemble and we are very pleased with the quality of the table.  We have been playing on it every day and are extremely satisfied.  Highly recommend this product.
This Stiga table is an excellent choice for this price range. I needed a table at home to supplement my practice at local table tennis clubs. This one stores efficiently and easily in my garage, sets up in about one minute, has good quality wheels, and a beautiful top finish. It came in perfect condition, and assembled easily by putting on 4 legs with bolts. The table came with good practice balls and an easy-to-use clamp-on net. My only problem has been with the net. It sits too high and I haven't been able to adjust it correctly yet.
We just finished our basement and I wanted a pingpong table for the grandkids.  I researched & decided this was the perfect table at a reasonable price. I ordered it on Friday and it was delivered on Monday.  My husband who is 79 and myself, 78, opened the box and put it together in about two hours.  (It would take others less time but we were very careful to read directions carefully and it was a heavy item to move and lift.  We took our time to be sure we didnt hurt the table or ourselves).  Having proper tools was a key to getting it together.  Two people working together also helps. Table was well packaged and protected. We used the cardboard as our place to work. The table is perfect and my husband & I are enjoying playing on it.  Cant wait for the grandkids to try it out next weeks.  I would recommend this as a purchase!
This is an awesome ping pong table. I was very impressed with the packaging and delivery. All of the materials are high quality, and setup was a breeze. The table itself is beautiful, the finish is smooth and blemish free. Im so happy that I decided on this model, especially going with the 3/4 table top. The bounce is amazing, and the net is easy to set up and also excellent quality. Im thrilled with this purchase, it was an excellent choice. Now, back to playing!
Stiga is a top brand for a reason!  The table was super high quality and the dark blue/slate color was gorgeous! I had thought I would need to spend at least $500 for a quality table for the office but the price for the Advantage was very reasonable.  Assembly was quick and easy; it took 15 minutes for  2 men, a pair of pliers, and a wrench.  I was even able to throw in a game during work hours for testing purposes ;) Had to make sure all was stable :) Item arrived in excellent condition with no damage.  Table was very well protected.  Amazon delivered it on time as promised with regular updates regarding delivery.  I opted for the 9:00am-12:00pm time slot.  How wonderful it was to see it already delivered to the office by 8:00am!
Assembling parts is not difficult but it takes two adults to lift and turn over both half sections after assembly.
Very nice and easy to assemble. First the delivery was messed up and we got the 'Legacy' table by mistake. But customer service was great and pick-up/re-delivery was arranged immediately. I don't recommend the 'Legacy' one, it's a nightmare to assemble. This one is so much better. Really quality surface and good bounce. The whole family is having fun :).
The table is very sturdy and was easy to assemble.  The net bracket seems sturdy and easier to keep taut compared to other designs I have used.  Having the two table halves as separate sections can take a little extra time to align.  But once everything is level and lined up, it seems to stay in place well.  We have had it setup for about a month and a half with no issues at this point.
Assembly was really easy - my son and I did it in about 10 minutes.  The whole table appears very sturdy.  I like the safety latch when you store the table vertically.  All the wheels have locks.  The net is great, very high quality clamp net (not one of those with butterfly bolts on the underside that always come loose).  Delivered about 20 minutes after the 3 hour window, but with a phone call warning me of the delay - this was very professional.
We purchased this as a Christmas present for our teenage boys.  The assembly couldn't have been easier.  All of the hardware was assembled on both sides of the table, and I only needed to assemble the casters and roll the two sides of the table in place.  The table looks sleek and clean and has a nice bounce.  My boys are picky, as they have played on friends' tables that they didn't like, but they love this table.  We are very happy with this purchase.  Couldn't believe the shipping was free, too!
Disappointed! Came with a square dent in the middle of one table. Also one of the 8 screws is shorter than the other 7 and can not be used. Therefore, one leg with wheels is not stable. Please let me know the solution. See pictures.
Good table but if you keep without net or play with one side fold, got misbalance. Small paints mark.
Bought this table for grandkids.  Our son and I put it together and set it up in under 30 minutes.  The only reason it took that long is we had to drill new 1/2 inch holes on one of the legs as the leg must have gone through the drill press machine incorrectly, as the holes for the bolts were drilled opposite the correct side.  No big deal.  The table is solid, easy to store or set up.  Perfect for what we envisioned, the grandkids learning a fantastic game which helps develop hand-eye coordination, is great fun, and is not electronic!
Grew up with Stiga 40 years ago so when it was time to train my Son I was exited to see the company still in business. I am glad I spent the extra money on the advantage PRO. Very sturdy and high quality.
Very happy with quality of this table, easy out of the box assembly, took less than 10 minutes to get ready to play. The delivery was less than stellar. Delivery came  4 hours early with no notice. This was a gift and the early delivery ruined the surprise.  Then the delivery gentleman asked to come into the house after hearing I was not home.  Realize the delivery is not a STIGA issue, but was the only negative part of experience. Very happy with purchase
this thing is incredible......so easy to put up.  I am 43 and my son is 16 and we knocked it out it 15 minutes and were soon playing.  We have used it non-stop and is so easy to put up.....I looked at several different tables and for the money, this can't be beat.
I couldnt be happier with my STIGA advantage Pro table.  Assembly was very easy, took under 15 minutes to put together with my wife.  It looks great in our basement, and it folds up in less than 2 minutes and stows away very nicely.  The overall playability of the surface is fantastic...  I am a good ponger that has played on tables that are thousands of dollars; those are only slightly better.  Truly a great value and a strong recommendation for anyone except people training for the olympics!
We bought this ping-pong table about two weeks ago, and has already had a lot of fun with it.  The table is easy to assemble. Instructions are included in the package. You will need a pair of wrenches to help fasten the screws. It took me about 30 minutes to assemble the table. The table's color and design fits well with our home.  As a beginner for ping-pong, I cannot tell the difference between this table and the professional ones. i would highly recommend this table.
Quality is great and it is very firm. Very durable and doesn't shake. Locks in the wheels keep it in place and the assembly is very simple. It took us only around twenty minutes to set up. The net is a easy step. You only need to clip it on and it holds on firmly. Table flips up and folds for easy storage. The wheels make it easy to adjust to your designated location. Overall a great table. I strongly recommend you buy it. It is worth the price.
Very good table, arrived early with minimal asthetic issues. Assembled in about 45 minutes with 2 people working on it. Quite easy assembly, they include an Allen wrench, however I'd also recommend having a regular wrench handy to tighten the lock nuts of the legs. Only issue is storing when not in use. We are tight on space, and although folding it up is very useful it does still require a bit of space in that configuration.
Once assembled, this is a fantastic table! really high quality and great for the price. The only issue is it's weight once delivered is very heavy. Make sure you are with another person and assemble the wheels on wherever the package lands so you can move it.
I wanted a ping pong table for a game room but didn't want one that was in the way all of the time.  This table is perfect!
Having played on this table at a friends house, I was very happy with its quality and ease of set up.  When it came time to buy one, the decision was a no-brainer.  The table came very well packaged in masonite reinforced cardboard. Though heavy, my wife and I were able to bring each half of the table downstairs to our basement.  The rest of the package contains the wheel assemblies, hardware and the net.  Set-up is a breeze and once each table half is resting on it's rollers, moving it around is easy even around tight corners. Folding and unfolding the table takes no effort at all and once set up, the table looks as good as it plays.
Was looking for a mid-level table that wasn't too expensive, but also not too cheap.  I'm really happy with this table.  It took ten minutes to unpack and set up.  The net was easy to attach and the table itself is nice quality.  The screenprint for the lines on the table are relatively flush, preventing any play issues.  All in all, a quality table easy to set up, and fun to play.  The kids love it and we have used this every day since we got it. Full size table, reasonable cost, good quality.  (we did have one corner plastic edge that was cracked upon delivery, but am working with Stiga to resolve).
Very nice table.  Good value, especially when I got it on a sale.  Was able to assemble by myself. Had to take my time and move it slowly because of the weight.  Great playing surface and sturdy my boys have already tested that!
Never thought it was so simple to assemble, it took me and my son 30mins only.
This is a very stable table.  Happy with it in every way.
Table was delivered with minor damage to the outer box, but it was packed well, so there was no damage to the table inside.  Setup was easy, but definitely benefits from having two people (adults) to move the large playing surface around while adding the legs/castors.  Pay attention to where the washers go, but otherwise it was easy to figure out.  Been using the table regularly since and it works great.
This stiga ping pong table is an exceptional quality purchase. To begin, the features are all very professional grade, ranging from the during blue top, to the aesthetically pleasing steal components. It is also a much better feel than our previous ping pong table, allowing for it to serve as a table for the more advanced players. The net also stands out, as it maintains a level height throughout the table, allowing for consistent play. The product was also very easy to assemble, and can be done in just minutes on your own. No downsides with this table, I highly recommend purchasing it!
Easy to set up (althought it is very heavy just open the box and move it one piece at a time). Moves easily even over carpet. Lots of fun.
This is a great buy. Great price. Easy pre-scheduled delivery; they called the day prior with 3 hour window, arrived 15 minutes early (!) after calling to make sure that was okay (and if it wasn't, said they'd wait until delivery window started). Easy, quick assembly. Essentially clear assembly instructions. Nice table; even on floor, looks nice, flat and even. Arrived pristine and without any damage. Can't really ask for much more.
Fantastic table, very sturdy, beautiful and great to play on.  The two separate table halves provide even greater flexibility for use.  I do need to glue some inside corners on the tables that were dislodged during shipping. Other than that, the table is perfect!
We bought this almost a year ago. But, just started using it about two months ago. The table itself is pretty good. We noticed that the net does not have an adjustment and there is a gap of about 1.5 to 2" under the net. So, the net is kind of high and there are is no way to adjust it. I am sure this is not standard. I just ordered a new net that is worth almost $100. Hope the Seller can cover the cost of the new net. We believe many of our shots are hitting the net as it is too high.
Table is good net and post arrived broken.  Ordered new net at Amazon request through stiga and received another broken net set.  Unable to play without net.  Getting the run around from Amazon highly dissatisfied
Purchased for our family with 3 very energetic boys who are tough/rough on toys.  The set was very easy to set up and sturdy.  The legs came assembled..only had to attach the casters/wheels and ready to play!  With folding and wheels...easy to store (we have a closet to roll into when not playing) or fold up to make room.  Sturdy table and net...easy for adults or kids to set up/play/take down.
This may be a little more expensive than some tables, but well worth it.  It is very durable and has a nice surface.  A warning though, with durability come weight.  It is quite heavy and you will want it delivered and placed close to the spot that you are going to set it up. My 13 y/o son set it up while I was at work.  He said that it was really easy to set it up. I got this table about a month ago and we have played 5-8 games every day.  It still looks brand new.
I really love this table.  It was extremely easy to assemble.  The only thing you have to do is attach 4 roller legs which took me about 15 minutes and it was ready to use.  The main legs are already attached and fold out very easily.  The table is excellent quality and looks very sleek.  Highly recommended
This ping pong table is a very good one! Easy to put it together, easy to be move around, and easy to be folded. The shipping was fast, and service is good! We have enjoyed it especially under the COVID-19 situation, playing ping pong is not only for exercise, also a very fun game, yet safe because it keeps good social distances:-)
I purchased this table based off all of the positive reviews on Amazon and upon receiving the table yesterday had set it up within half an hour by myself. In regard to the table, the quality is next to none! it is extremely heavy duty and playable. You will need at least two bigger guys to carry this pre-assembled minimum. The assembly was brisk and to the point, only the wheels are required to attached to both side of the base. After that, it is easy to wheel around and store. Each individual side can be used as a table for other purposes if needed. I actually have the intention of using it to play poker on when it's not being used. Totally worth the buy!
It's hard to believe this table only costs $400! It looks amazing, is very sturdy, the net is top notch, it plays great, and it was truly a breeze to assemble. I was skeptical of the claim that it only takes 10 minutes to assemble, but it's true. It basically comes fully assembled. Assembly was literally just a matter of bolting the wheels on. It's also very easy to operate in terms of folding it up and moving it around. I couldn't imagine a more painless experience of setting up and operating something that seems like it should be cumbersome bulky item. It tucks away in the corner, folds half way into a single player practice table, or all the way down into a full table in seconds. I would absolutely recommend this table to anyone shopping for a table tennis table. 5 stars!
some screws came off two metal strips that support edges near the net area. Other than that, it looks great and works great.
We bought this table in the summer and play at least a few times per month.  The table is pretty heavy - it is definitely a two person job move it to where you need it (even if you just lift one half of the table).  Once we got  everything unpacked, assembly was pretty easy, and the table is easy to store.  Overall it was a great family investment.
We bought this as the second round of shutdowns/lockdowns was occurring.  It's a great indoor activity for the winter months.  The table is well built, easy to assemble and level, and the net system is brilliant.  An excellent value and highly recommended.
Shipping was pretty fast considering this was a freight size delivery. Ping pong table is very good looking, plays well, and was not overly complicated to assemble. The parts seemed to have jostled loose in shipment, but we dont believe it was due to poor packing. Its the nature of moving two big boxes across the country. We like how it comes apart in two sections for storage - this is a great feature! Recommend this for families who have some experience to good experience levels.
Good table - comes mostly assembled - just need to attach the wheels to each of the legs.  One of the metal support braces was not connected when I got the table - I think the screws that they use when building the table are not that great.  Table is easy to fold, but if you have a thick carpet (as in my case), you have to be careful that the legs underneath are not also folding at the same time as the table top is folding.  I wish the wheels were better for deep carpets.
Was easy to put together and move it from room to room by one person. Has a game night and everyone had a great time playing it and it's still in great shape after multiple kids playing it who are not exactly careful. :-)
I bought this table for our family game room with the main players being my 14 and 10 year old sons.  It took my son and I about an hour to have it fully assembled from the time we cut the box open until it was ready to play.  It was an easy assembly and the directions were easy to follow.  So far, we have enjoyed playing.  The only thing that I think this table is lacking is a latch that locks the two halves together during play.  I think this would be helpful to keep the table from getting misaligned during play.  I hope it will last for many years to come!
This a great table for home. Wish I could have bought it before, to pull my adolescent child away from iPads and gadgets. This has now become our favorite family fun activity. This Stiga table is easy to store and occupies very minimal space..we are still able to put our two cars in the garage. Table is a very elegant and specially love the blue color table top. Each  table half come on set of 4 wheels making it very easy to handle and store them separately. Overall a must have product for all age groups in family to have REAL fun !!!
I was a little hesitant to spend this much money on a table, but it has been worth it. It was easy to assembly and is quick and easy to put up and put away. We can leave one side up so one person can play and when the pieces are folded together it is easy to roll around and move. We've played on it a ton since Christmas and has been well worth the money. We also bought a cover to go over it when folded up to help protect it when we're not playing.
One of the reasons I chose this table was because it was 95% pre-assembled.  My 15 year old daughter was very anxious to get this table so she volunteered to help set it up, not really excited about that but the 2 of us had the table out of the box and ready to play in under 30 minutes!  The table has had a lot of action, including a New Year's Eve tournament with a basement full of teenagers!  Very sturdy and well made and it looks great.  It is heavy, so I'm happy that I paid to have  it brought down to the basement.  In hindsight, I probably could have just paid the delivery guys to do it when they got here, but they got a nice Christmas tip anyway!
The Stiga Advantage Table Tennis table was so easy to put together. It was delivered right on time and my husband and I had no problem getting it set up where we wanted it. So far it has been a real hit with everyone in the family. I am totally satisfied.  I would recommend it.
the table is great but the box came mangled and one of the metal supports was bent. My husband straighten it with his tools but it still shows a dent
We dont have the space to just leave a ping pong table up the whole time. We have to put it away after each use. This table is extremely easy to fold up and wheel away to our utility room. Assembly was easy out of the box. Im sure gameplay is not as good as a tournament quality table, but any minor disparity is worth it given how much less expensive this table is compared to tournament tables.
The quality is really good. I think it is identical with the tables that are used for international table tennis games.  It is quite easy to assemble and fold, very straightforward instructions. It's bit heavy if you wanted to move it upstairs/downstairs. But the weight is not a problem once it is settled as the wheels make it very easy to move on the same floor. Also the weight helps make the table to be steady and this is the feature that I like the best. It won't move or shake like many other light tables do. Love it!
This is an excellent table for anyone just casually playing in the basement with friends & family, as well as those who are a bit more competitive. It has got a great thickness, build, and is tournament regulation size. The assembly was extremely easy. This took less than 10 minutes to assemble, as it came 95% pre-assembled out of the box. The only difficult part of the entire thing was getting multiple people to carry the extremely heavy box to our desired location. NOTE: The table did have a very tiny rubber corner piece that came broken off. Immediately called Amazon and they helped fix the issue. I still wanted to give this table a 5 star review as it truly is 5 star worthy, even if it came with a small broken piece. This most likely occurred during transportation / shipping. Would definitely recommend this table to others.
Product doesn't seem durable or high quality as advertised.  The corner of the table was split and chipped right out of the box.  Will likely return.
This is a quality ping pong table that my family has already gotten a lot of use out of.  I highly recommend it. I was worried about how much time it would take to assemble, seeing as how I procrastinated and only had a couple of hours on Christmas Eve to assemble it for a Christmas morning surprise.  They are serious when they say 95% assembled.  I think it took me and my wife about an hour and a half to get everything unpacked, sorted, and built. The moving mechanisms move very easily.  I was afraid going from level playing surface to upright (to save space) would be difficult, jerky, or could pinch fingers.  It's very smooth and easy.  The wheels on the table make it very easy to move.  I really like that I have a full size table that I can set up in about 2 minutes, but can also fold up very easily and store it out of the way just as quickly.  It even moves easily on carpet. The box is heavy and bulky.  I appreciate the effort they go through to ensure that the table itself doesn't get dented, but it makes moving it and disposing of it difficult.  I paid the extra $20 for the table to be delivered to my room of choice, and since that involved a flight of stairs it was money very well spent.  The delivery was about 2 hours later than the 3 hour window I was given, but I blame the delivery service for that - obvious that has nothing to do with the quality of the table. I had to use a large knife to cut the box once everything was put together because it was too big/bulky to easily get out of the basement and out to the curb for recycling. It might be more manageable if you have two people to work together to carry it out. Again, this in no way detracts from the quality of the table - I say this more so you have a good idea of what you'll need to plan for. I'm very pleased with this purchase and the quality of this table.  I think you'll be glad with your decision if you choose to purchase it.
Table was delivered quickly and it was nice to be able to arrange a time slot for the delivery. I chose 6-9 AM on a Saturday and they came at 7 (amazing they delivered that early!). I paid the $19.99 extra to have them deliver to any room in the house (basement, in my case). I DEFINITELY recommend that! The box is extremely heavy and you don't want to hurt yourself. It is not too hard to assemble if you follow the instructions carefully. I did it by myself but I would recommend two people. I ALMOST ruined the table so there is one very important thing to note: after you attach the legs and wheels and you are turning the table upright, if you are "tilting it" up DO NOT tilt in the direction of the hinges. Tilt toward the center side. I did it in the hinge direction first and the hinges started bending before I realized what was happening. If you have two people you may be able to lift and flip it over without tilting it avoiding that altogether. I can't get the table fully level but the net pulls the sides even. I wish there was instructions on how to "tighten" the net but I figured it out from some videos on-line. The table seems high quality and I look forward to playing on it more. It is easy to fold up to get out of the way when needed.
We love this ping pong table.  The pre-arranged delivery time was perfect for our busy schedules.  It was easy to assemble as the instructions were easy to follow and there were no missing parts, took about 45 minutes.  It is of good quality.  The delivery box was of substantial size and it took 2 strong men to get it down to our basement.  The table had great packing (which made it heavier to carry) but we didn't have any damage to the table so we were happy that it was packed so securely. The wheels make it easy to move and they lock and keep the table in place. The table top is smooth and looks better than the ones we've seen at other peoples homes.  The balls (bought separately) bounce nicely on the table.  The table is two separate pieces so storing it will be easy if it's not in use.  We looking forward to using it often with our family!
I had the table delivered to my front porch, it's actually really heavy, it took 4 people to bring it inside so if I bought it again I would choose the option to have it delivered inside. When we opened it up the table had no damage, and all of the parts were accounted for, all safely wrapped. The table comes almost completely assembled, and if it weren't for the weight, it'd be easy for one person to do on their own. All you'll need to assemble it is a wrench and a pair of pliers. Once assembled it's easy for one person to fold the table into its storage position or the position for one person to practice. The wheels roll easily on carpet and tile. The table surface itself is smooth with no imperfections, and the net system does a good job of keeping the two halves level, even on an uneventful surface. I'm particularly impressed with the net posts, compared to others I've seen I don't expect them to break/warp or stop working for any other reason. There are knobs on each post to lower/raise the net on either side, and the tightness of the net can also easily be adjusted. I don't know too much about playing surfaces but the ball bounces and the table plays just fine. Would recommend 10/10
As we are under a stay at home quarantine, I ordered the table for something to do to get us moving. It was delivered when they said. It is very heavy. We had to take the box apart in order to lift the 2pieces one at a time to get it down the stairs to the basement. Once we had both pieces, all the assembly required was a screw driver. In all it took about 20 min to put together. The table had no nicks or scratches, came in perfect condition.
Packaged very securely and little damage to outside box.  This table is very good quality, very easy to set up (less than 15 minutes) and looks like it will give us years of fun.  I am in NC and have it set up in the garage.  Haven't tried the solo playback yet, but looks pretty straight forward to do.  Had a hiccup getting here, Amazon lost the first one, but they made it right and got the replacement here in 24 hours after we requested the replacement.
We bought the Stiga after doing lots of research and watching GooTube videos. We decided on the thickest table for stability. The thing is a monster. Very durable and good quality. It shipped quickly and was easy to assemble. It took longer to get it out of the box than it did to assemble it. We have been using the table almost daily since we received it in early January, 2019. I wanted to experience it for a while before i did a review on it. The table tucks away in a small "footprint" of space when tilted vertically. We mostly keep it in Play Mode though. It's quite large -I believe it's "regulation size. We intended to put it in a certain room, it would have fit, however it left little room for us to play. We have in the great room and it's there greeting us when we walk in the front door! You will find yourself getting really good at this game, the more you play it. The table takes top-spins, cuts and slices very well.
I upgraded the delivery charge to have the table put in the correct room of the house. It was worth it - this box is heavy. We had plenty of room to assemble - but keep in mind - it does take some space to put together. Assembly is amazingly easy. A little assistance is needed to "flip" the tables, but otherwise, it is an easy job putting this thing together. Adjustments are easy. Fit and finish isn't perfect - but nothing that I'm concerned about. Everyone has had fun playing on the table.
Just mounted easily alone and ready for tmrw Christmas morning. Wheels are large and easy to roll.  Very heavy solid tables. Beautiful even competition markings.  A little soft table anti-close bars. Otherwise very impressed.  Look forward to playing with our teen twins. Being Swedish and played on Stiga table since childhood u was hoping quality was there.  $400 worth it. Next review after play...
I love this table -- I had been searching for a ping pong table and during my research kept coming back to the STIGA Advantage table tennis table. It is very sturdy and the table top is very smooth and has a great bounce with the ball.  This is definitely worth the money and the best decision I made. I like that it is 2 separate tables and I will definitely take advantage of this.  The table easily separates to set up to practice and play by yourself or to store it but I will be keeping it up all the time as I have a large area where it is in my basement. I took advantage of the assembly that Amazon offered and was very pleased with Scott.  Scott never assembled a ping pong table before but he did a great job all by himself even though this table weighed 190 lbs.  From the start of opening the package to the final step of the table ready to play it took him about 1 hour.  I am sure it will be a little less with more than 1 person.  He feels now that he assembled this one it would take less time to assemble the next one.  It advertises 10 minute quick play design since it is 95% assembled but not sure what they mean because even if all the parts were ready to assemble and you put it together and make sure it is tight and sturdy it would take longer than 10 minutes. I would highly recommend this table for the price and table quality. STIGA makes the best tables so check them out first if you are interested in one.
Picked this table based on good reviews, looking for something decent quality (not pro level) with easy foldability but solid play for fun level. It gets 5 stars based on those criteria. Very happy with the look and overall feel, feels like very solid construction and durable folding leg design. Assembly was simple, 8 bolts to put the feet on. The delivery box is huge and heavy, but once you open it up, the parts are reasonable to carry anywhere. Should have two people for the table pieces, but one strong person could likely manage it. Only part of assembly that might need two people is turning it back upright after the feet are on, but even then one person can manage it if needed. Setup/teardown of this table might take a minute. Maybe. It's so easy, no reason not to take the time every time it's used. Definitely 5 stars for this aspect of it. But also stays solidly in place once down, nice wheels and locks there. The table has a good feel to play on. I tested the ball bounce with a new ball and we measured it at 23cm or so (compared to 27 for a pro table), but a little less bounce was expected. The pro level table is thicker so I expect is higher bounce, but this table certainly feels nice (would have guessed closer to regulation based on just hitting on it). As I type this review my son has it in the single player practice configuration (again, because of easy foldability, it's trivial to setup this way). Definitely something from which we're going to get a lot of use.
The description said the product was 95% put together. It was not. I would have paid for someone to put it together for me. I can not put it together properly. The man who delivered it was 90 years old and I had to carry it in on my own. I would return the product except I no longer have the box.  I have tried to put it together but I am incapable.  The description said 95% put together which I thought meant put the net on. It was misleading to the buyer.
Good solid table top. Solid construction and Good design. All hardware accompanied the table and was easy to setup. I was able to attach the casters easily and the net was also easy to install. The clamps that hold the table together are strong and keep the two halves together. It was also very easy to fold one half for single practice or both halves to store when not in use. Very happy with the purchase so far and look forward to many hours of use. This table comes in a single carton which is quite heavy and well packed.  I was able to complete assembly and setup completely with just myself but recommend 2 people for flipping each half over after assembling the hardware. FYI - You will need at least two strong people to move this if you are going upstairs or maneuvering in tight spaces.
Just perfect for our family.  Scheduled a delivery when it was convenient, and (although not recommended) I was able to set this up entirely by myself (took about an hour taking my time as I needed to rearrange furniture to make room for set-up).  I took a picture of the only tools that I needed to use.  Trickiest part was sliding out of the box carefully, and then once the wheeled legs went on, flipping it right side up (which was pretty easy by tipping onto the stationary legs first).  So very easy to roll around and set into place, then lock the wheels.  This is a very well made table, and Im extremely pleased with how well this works in a smaller space that needs the flexibility of being able to fold up up flat against the wall sometimes.
OK ... I'll be honest. I had my reservations about a 200 pound package, drop shipped, then two (well, just say grandparents) hauling it inside and assembling this beast. My fears were totally unfounded. The shipping company was on-time, very helpful, and got the package where we could unpackage the parts and handle them separately. Since this install is for the basement, no simple task, but it worked well. Packaging was stout. The outside of the box was really beaten up. Again, I had concerns about whether the table would be cracked or broken. Not so. The inside packaging protecting the corners was really stount and stood up to plenty of external shipping abuse with nary a problem. Quality: We haven't played yet, and we aren't pros, so this table is better quality than I can play. One problem was some of the edgebanding at a corner was loose and flapping. I took some J B Weld epoxy and held it under tension for an hour. Good as new. Color: Just like advertised. A very nice blued that should play well under an LED light. Assembly: Easy with straightforward manual. I had the table assembled in 30 minutes or less.
I have a just big enough space in my basement for a table so a permanent table was out of the question. This thing folds up so easily and is easily movable (even on my carpet) so storing it in the boiler room/closet is perfect. Fits right through the doors easily. There is no way that tables that have both sides permanently attached would fit, this thing does easily. I put up and then take down this table every time we use it, probably five times a week. Only been 4 weeks so far but it gets folded a ton and it looks like it will maintain this just fine. So far holding up great and when clamped together with the net spring the table is flat and nicely lined up, even on old uneven carpet it. I imagine on smooth concrete or other totally flat and hard surface it would be a dream.
The table was delivered on time by a private company. I opted for porch delivery, so they left the box by the garage door. The box is TOO HEAVY! ~400lbs... Moving it around is definitely not a single man job, for SURE! I recommend opening the box and then moving the pieces to the desired place, instead of wrestling the box around the house. The packaging is AMAZING! Fused compressed cardboard create and exoskeleton like shell insuring no scratches or damages to the table during shipping. The assembly is a breeze, it definitely helps to have an extra hand with you. Either way we had it up and running in 20mins, including moving the parts to the basement. No drilling, just some nuts and bolts. Very happy with my purchase, especially with the winter times around the corner! Plenty of fun and competition to keep us warm!
We ordered this ping pong table a few months ago. The previous table we had was very old and outdated, and VERY HEAVY, as it was one piece as opposed to two pieces, like this one. The delivery guys brought the box right inside the house for us as it was a pretty heavy box and we were able to slide it across the floor to a bigger area to assemble it. I don't have patience for putting things together so I made my husband do it and it didn't take him too long, maybe a couple of hours (I'm sure there were distractions as he was putting it together). As the table comes in two parts, it makes it SO EASY to move each piece and carry it to where we need it to be (we don't play inside the house so when we do play, we're easily able to lift it and carry it out to the back patio). It folds up so easily, and it actually does not fold high (the storage shed we store it in is a 6ft. door opening and when the table is folded up, this goes right under the door frame) and the wheels make it easy to roll across flat surfaces. The table itself works really well and the ball gets a good bounce which is great for volleying back and forth. We love the table and highly recommend!
So I was sitting on the fence about buying a table tennis, I am so happy that I bought it. The play-ability on this table is superb,  had a good friend of mine that bought over 1k table and told me that this table is actually little better. The balls are bouncing great, the blue color is fun, the quality is great. I was little skeptical about the shipping since some people mention that might be a prob, but this table came so well protected, even though i had to move the box to the basement it took the hits and stay in great shape, no dents no prob. The assembly was a breeze, one person could put this one together with no problems. Over wall thumbs up, great family exercise for the cold weather. Enjoy.
It's a great table, and works well.  The video in the product details covers everything worth mentioning about the function of the table, the only other thing I could add, is how easy it is to roll around on a hard surface open or closed.  So easy to move around in my basement!  The reason for the negative rating is ours showed up with some unacceptable manufacturing flaws that weren't minor.  Customer service was great and replaced the table quickly, but the replacement had an issue too. Details: We bought the table on amazon, it showed up right on time, no damage to the package.  Instructions were fine, and it's super easy to assemble.  Here's where we started noticing issues though.  One of the red locking safety clips which comes premounted on the table was ripped out on one side.  It was obviously shipped this way from the manufacturer, because 3 of the 6 screws with chunks of mdf on them, were in the box with the rest of the bolts, the other 3 were missing.  The table top surface had 2 deep scratches about 3 inches long, 1 on each side.  The scratches were deep down through the finish into the mdf about 1mm wide, and obvious from a distance.  Lastly, the finish was terrible.  You could see obvious ripples in color about an inch apart across the entire table, and there was an area in the middle of each quadrant about a foot long and 6 inches wide that looked almost worn through.  The playing surface just looked cheap, or something you would see on a beat up old table.  To be honest, this stuff isn't that big of a deal and I would have been fine with this if I had bought it used for $150 off of someone. We reached out to customer service, they were incredibly friendly, helpful, and resolved the issue quickly.  They asked us to send us some pictures of it, and within a day they told us they'd ship us a completely new table, which we were relieved about.  The new table came and this time the surface looked perfect.  Weirdly it was a completely different shade of blue this time, much lighter in color.  The only issue with the new one is that the net they shipped it with had about a 4 inch runner in it about 1/2 an inch up from the bottom.  Functionally no big deal, and i just swapped the net with the one that came on the first table.  Overall I'm incredibly happy now, but this stuff is worth mentioning.
I was pretty excited to get the new table. I was very disappointed. On one side of the box, for both table tops that stacked, there were damages on the corners upon arrival. I think a $425 table should be better than this. I am afraid this is NOT a good purchase.
A great quality table, easy to put together and all for a reasonable price. Our table arrived in excellent shape, delivered by Amazon who were flexible enough to take the really heavy package to the back of our house. It definitely takes two people to carry and flip the two halves of the table once youve attached the legs which is very straightforward. I was surprised that the two halves didnt attached together at the legs like higher priced tables are and was concerned that the table would move a bit when you lean onto the table to reach for a ball but that hasnt been the case and the table plays extemely well. So overall very happy with the table. The missing star is due to the attachment, and may well give it 5 after using the table for a longer period of time.
The first table delivered was constructed of a pressed paper laminate and arrived with two crunched corners and a bent wheel from an apparent drop. The replacement table arrived undamaged and was constructed of good old fashion particle board. Evidently this table is made from a number of different manufacturers. The first table was light royal blue color and the second one a darker almost navy blue. Bottom line if you get one that is damaged you'll need to be confident in your repacking skills because the total weight is around 200 pounds. I managed fine and I'm not a big man (70 years old 160 lbs). The table has a good simple design and looks like it will hold up for many years. My wife and I play a set of games every single day and love it.
I spent a lot of time researching the best tables and I am so glad I decided on this one, it is beautiful! Delivery was right on time. It came in an impressively packaged box with even each piece of hardware individually wrapped. The blue surface is like silk and the overall durability is top of the line, this is a heavy, well designed table. The quality far exceeded what I expected and I expected a lot. The playability is better than anything Ive played on in the past, incredible ball response and controlability. The net string slip knot needed to be adjusted to get a better tension on the net, but it worked out great. The build time was maybe 15 minutes with only the tightening of a few nuts to bracket on the leg and wheel assembly. The design of the folding halves is well done and solid with the way it locks into place. I couldnt be happier with this purchase. Stop your research here and get the Stiga Advantage. You will be overly pleased with the decision.
I searched the Denver area for a place to buy and take home a high quality ping pong table for indoor home use.  I simply gave up and, after reviewing several of the top brands, chose the Stigma Advantage Pro.  I was please to see that Amazon offered a 'deliver to the room' option for the nominal fee of $20 and received my table in less than a week.  The easy attachment of the 4 wheel assemblies was all that was required to get going and, voila, the table was ready for action.  We immediately put it to the test and were quite impressed with its performance.  I might add, that it provides a professional, high quality appearance as well a very rugged feel.  5 thumbs up!
We have been using our Stiga Advantage table for a little over a month now, and it has been perfect. There are so many indoor ping pong tables available - we went with Stiga because we know it's a quality brand, and we were not disappointed. The table was easy to assemble (legs are bolted onto each table half with the table upside down, and two people are needed to flip the table halves onto the legs). It looks great and we've been playing it non-stop. Highly recommend! The mark of a great table is that your attention is never focused on the table itself when playing, and this one fits that bill, allowing us to spend our thoughts and energy on perfecting our topspin winners all day long!
I have wanted a ping pong table for years! I bought this one on an Amazon flash sale for Christmas. It is absolutely the best table and well worth the full price if it is not on sale. Very easy to put together, (with two strong people because it is heavy out of the box). But once together, it is so easy to fold up right and store until you want to play. It is 2 tables that clamp together at the net. I usually keep one table upright and the other flat against it so I can practice by myself.  I just love it.
The screws and bolts don't fit together such that the legs stay wobbly. The bolt would go all the way through and gets stuck on screw just after couple of turns. Called Amazon fulfillment center to get replacement parts and they could not get hold of Stiga so only option given to me was to return the item. Now to pack this up and bring it up from the basement was not a good option. So after 2 trips to Home Depot and spending 2 hours in that - bought the bolts that fit properly and then was able to assemble the table. However, the mechanism of this flat metal strip that makes legs fold was very loose too. I am worried if that will give way or bend overtime as I fold and unfold legs. Expected much better from Stiga.
This ranks No.1 horrific experience with Amazon yet. The table shipped in with a major broken part that is impossible to fix. The screws that connect the leg with table is broken out of the table synthetic wood, and impossible to drill in again. The position is a fixed on so no way to drill at another location either. It is a huge piece of junk sitting in my backyard now. What's more terrible, it is table only, no net or the clippers. How could something go wrong this much..
We got our Advantage Pro table with a Prime day deal for $399! Unfortunately one of the legs with casters had the holes drilled in the wrong directions. I called the company asking for them to send a replacement leg, but was told that they can't (was very unhelpful! Initially suggesting I should go through the warranty!)  and that I should call Amazon. Amazon, great as usual, is sending a replacement table. I really wish I could just get the part that I need.  It is a very heavy table ! Beside the issue with the leg- was very easy to set up.  It is our first ping pong table , so not sure how compares to others. A bit strange that the two halves are connected only via the clips that hold the net. So far so good. Will update in a few months
Now the family hangs out around the ping pong table waiting for their turn.  Delivery was awesome! Tracked the truck while it was driving to the house inside the delivery window.  Delivery was fine, packaging was intact, product was in perfect shape when un-boxed.  Moved it to the basement myself piece by piece and assembled downstairs.  Leveling is easy even on un-level floors.  Just need a score board so I can brag how good I am! Highly recommend this table.
I am very satisfied with this ping pong table.  It was delivered within days, and the delivery man was very nice in getting it into the utility room so that I could unpack it from there.  The color is a pretty blue, much better for my decor than the standard green that I remember from childhood.  What I liked the best was that my sister and I were able to attach the caster legs fairly simply once we found the proper socket wrenches from the garage.  I am used to manufactures sending these along with the product, but they were not included here.  That would be my only complaint.  Two people are needed to get the table in working order--not because it is difficult (it came fully assembled except for the caster-wheeled legs), but because it is large and very heavy.  I checked prices and found this one to be quite reasonable for a quality item and one that is almost totally pre-assembled.  That was a must when I was considering a purchase. On my must list was the ability to play solo and to be able to fold for storage if needed.  I haven't tried either of these options yet, but I am glad that they are available.  I also purchased The Upstreet Box Set: 4 Ping Pong Paddles which arrived a few days after the table.  It, too, is a quality product.  We are using the table every night during our "happy hour" and having a lot of fun.  My cats are enjoying it, too, as they love watching the game and acting as "interference" when they settle on the table and bat at balls that come their way.  They want to play as well!  I highly recommend this table and am so glad that I didn't buy the pre-assembled table that I had seen earlier for double the price.  You won't regret this purchase if you are looking for a quality, regulation sized ping pong table that is almost ready to play on right out of the box.  Just a postscript: it is not intended for outside use.
The table itself is great quality. It comes mostly assembled, and I was able to construct it by myself. As a word of warning, once assembled, it is difficult to move up and down stairs, although I was able to do so with a second person without any disassembly. The table consists of two halves. The halves line up and are held together by pressure clamps for the net. I have found that they remain aligned very well, even if the table is lightly bumped during play. Each half is also incredibly easy to lift and latch vertically, either for storage or for single person play. The play surface is uniform and high quality. Ball response has been consistent across the surface and has not degraded over several months of use. Overall, I am very pleased with this table.  Would recommend!
The table is exactly what we were looking for and expected after reading the product description, viewing the photos, and perusing user reviews. Delivery service; horrible.  The underside of the table is scratched up due to the box connecting with something else that was heavy.  Even though the box was banged up, the delivery guy didnt ask if I wanted to inspect anything.  Also, the guy couldnt even lift the box and get into my entryway.  He asked if he could roll it end over end, and I said fine as long as he was super careful.  I ended up doing it myself because he was struggling so bad.  After the delivery guy ran out of the house, I opened up the box to my damaged table.  I was very happy the table surface was not damaged. The packaging did protect most of the underside, but there are some scratches and one of the metal supports is bent up.
This table arrived perfectly.  They used a shipping company called Pilot, and they arrived on time and unloaded the table in my garage (where I'm going to use it).  They were very polite and efficient.  The packing on the table was beyond incredible.  There was no way this product was going to be damaged in shipment.  The heavy duty cardboard was lined with 1/2" MDF around the four edges and 1/16" MDF glued to inside of the large flat surfaces.  In addition, the table corners were protected by rubber or plastic protectors that were so sturdy I initially thought they belonged on the playing table.  The table came out of the box in perfect condition.  The set up was a piece of cake.  There are four legs with 4" wheels to install which took maybe 10-15 minutes.  I opened the box flat on the floor, installed the two legs on the table half on top, put some cushion on the floor, tipped (with my wife's help) the half table up on its edge and then up on its wheels.  Then we flipped over the bottom half and did the same thing.  Most of my time was spent carefully using a box cutter to open the box on the floor.  It was a breeze.  The table is beautiful with no blemishes.  It plays like a dream.  the 3/4" MDF creates a great bounce.  I spent $127 on Amazon for a pack of six, 2 tube, LED fixtures that are linkable.  They are very light weight and a breeze to hang on the ceiling.  I don't think the pattern is important as they are so bright.  I used one of those Christmas tree type remotes to turn all the lights on and off.
The table is very heavy. So either two people are needed to move to your location or you might think about the room of choice delivery. Once there the packaging is simpler to open and assemble. I noticed a small bump on one of the halfs on the left side and called amazon and they mentioned i need to repack and leave it at the door. Now, this is in the basement and moving there is a heck of a work. So i decided to live with it. I feel if room of choice was then return too should be from that room and if not return becomes a hassle. The bounce is okay not great. Since its entry level table probably okay. Since i dont know other entry level tables this is something i will live with. Aligning the two halves and making sure they are even is a exercise in patience. The same goes for aligning for the single person mode. If this table stays at same place then probably best use case.
My wife and I are really enjoying the table so far.  The delivery guys showed up promptly at the scheduled time and were very nice.  They initially showed up out front, but our garage is in the back and that's where I wanted it dropped off.  They had zero issue with getting back in the truck and pulling around. Setting up the table is a relative breeze as well.  The instructions were all very clear and easy to follow.  I took my time and was done in about an hour.  1/2 of that time was getting everything out of the box and staged for a quicker assembly.  I was able to do everything by myself except for the last part where you need to flip the two halves over; my wife helped with that. The table plays very well and the surface was in mint condition.  I didn't have any scratches or issues like some others mentioned.  We're really enjoying it so far and can see us having loads of fun for years to come.  The storage process is more simple than I imagined.  The latches to secure the halves in place seem very sturdy and folding everything up is ridiculously simple.  The wheels are a very size for a table of this weight and everything is supported very well.  The wheel locks have also worked very well so far.  The net is also very high quality and keeps the halves together very well. I highly recommend this table due to the quality and the price point.
If I could give this ping pong table more than five stars I'd max them out. It's such a solidly constructed table. We purchased it for our kids and grandkids when they visit so they'd have more to do in-doors especially during the pandemic. We were all so careful prior to gathering the week after Christmas so inside entertainment was something we needed more than in the past. I also love that it folds with a backboard so you can play one on one against the table and that you can spot them apart, cover them with table cloths and have expanded sitting room for large dinner parties. Very versatile and extremely sturdy.
I bought this table when there was a one day price drop to $299. Cant beat the price especially with free delivery. Delivery was earlier than expected. I had a delivery window of 6-9pm, but the carrier called me at 3pm and asked if they could deliver early. Solid packaging that protects the table from damage. Assembly wasnt 10 minutes as advertised. Its not hard, but for an average person, it will take you a little longer. You need time to open the box, sort the parts, figure out what you are going to do. To tighten the screws, I took some time to find 2 wrenches. One to tighten and the other to hold the nut in place. The only complaint are the hinges and how fragile they are. You have to be careful not to bend them when you fold and unfold the table. Then, you need to spend some time trying to level the table by adjusting the legs. So maybe 10 minutes if youve assembled tables before, but chances are, it will take you at least 30 minutes. Once assembled, its an excellent table to play on. I expect to keep this for many years.
I purchased this table for my family to use as an indoor table. The table was much better than I expected. Its a high quality table that was very easy to assemble and has wonderful aesthetics. The net is the best quality I have ever seen and does NOT come off the table until you want it to. Buy this table and you will NOT be disappointed
We love the table! It is indeed very easy to set up, especially as it comes in two distinct parts. (My son and I carried them separately to the basement with no problem.) Total assembly took about 15 minutes. We were initially concerned that as two distinct parts the table might separate during play, but after a week that hasn't been an issue. The only change I might make is to have a thicker table for slightly better bounce. On the other hand, we'd have had more trouble moving the thing.
I have been using this ping pong table for only 3 months and the performance is excellent! The playability is very easy and fun to play with! The quality of the table good but the white paint on the edges of the table came off a bit. There were no dents or anything so the quality is 93% great. The table fits in pretty well in our basement but our basements a bit small so we don't have a lot of space to play with. The assembly took us about 1 hour but it was very easy to put everything together. The hardest part was to carry it downstairs because it weighed a lot. Also, it is very easy to change it into the play position, playback position, and the storage position. Overall, the experience is great. I recommend other people to buy this ping pong table.
Be sure you have a nice flat surface as the wheels are small. Great value, well packaged and easy to assemble. I had this together on my own in 20 min. I would reccomend 2 people to lift it onto the legs the first time.
Overall I was very satisfied with the quality and usability of the Stiga Advantage Indoor Table Tennis Table. Upon receiving the table, I was shocked at the quality of the parts and the ease of setup. With the help of a very detailed setup guide, assembling the table took around 15 minutes and required minimal tools and effort. All the parts fit together perfectly and are made out of a strong metal material. One of the things I have enjoyed the most about this table is how easy it is to fold up and move around. This along with its modern look made it the perfect centerpiece for our basement! After playing with the table for several weeks, it has held its consistent bounce and the net has been perfect. Overall very satisfied with this table.
Really great table.  My son and I play tons and my wife plays some too.  It is really heavy so having two people is almost necessary to assemble.  The delivery was perfect and exactly as scheduled.  And, this is most important, there was no damage!!  I was really worried about it coming damaged and having to deal with it, but nothing - lucky me!!!
We have this ping pong table in our basement for our sons to play with and while they've enjoyed it, I can't say that the quality of the table is very good for the price we paid. The screws that attach the table top to the frame are coming out and stripping and so it's not really holding together. We bought this table for Christmas 2017 and it's been coming apart since we first put it together. This has been a disappointing purchase. I expected this ping pong table to last longer given the price and the other reviews I read.
Quality table, delivered in good condition and we're enjoying playing on it. Easy to move, easy to assemble. A the boxes heavy, make sure you get help carrying it. Ideally you will be home when it's delivered to you can have the delivery folks place it for you. The net system is quite easy to maneuver as well. I'm glad I purchased this.
I liked that it was super quick to get assembled so that we could start playing within minutes. I also like that each piece is separate which makes it easier to move around. FYI, the box is extremely heavy, it is easier to move the pieces individually to the location you wish to have the table.
Had it delivered to my basement.  (It's heavy, so pay for someone else to move it to any inaccessible place.)  Set it up on Christmas.  Two late thirties guys to do the assembly, which was quite simple (if you have the right wrenches).  All the parts were there.  Set up was quick.  Nice surface to play on.  The kids are enjoying it right now!
First, I must say I thoroughly enjoy the table as do my son and son-in-law. If I could give this table 4 and 1/2 stars I would as you must have someone else to help maneuver the table due to its weight. The table is in my basement and I found the best way to move it was to open the box and carry the 2 pieces downstairs. Once there it took no more than 15 minutes to put it together. Very satisfied with the product.
Took me and my son 30-minutes to setup.  Assembly is simple, smooth and the completed table is solidly aligned. The steel frame look strong yet still light enough.  I like the way the two halves could be folded up separately and stored in a compact way.  Very nice net and posts that could be put up in seconds. The table surface has a dark green paint that feel strong and smooth.  I can't complaint about the ball bouncing, it is just right.
Very good table, easy to assemble, easy to store and came in a very well protected package. Only issue was the net, not up to the quality mentioned above and mine actually was torn from one of the lower sides.
Been using it for 2 weeks now. Was very easy to assemble. Net is well made and holds up tightly. The table itself is a little slower than what I expected. But bounce is very even, even at the edges and near the net. I haven't tried to fold it to put it away, so cannot comment on that aspect. It's a good looking table, and is of high quality. I shopped around quite a bit and for the price it's a good deal.
Like: 1. Price (was on sale) 2. Ease of assembly 3. Even bounce and Spin 4. Perfect for beginners / novices 5. Quality of net and clamps Dislikes: 1. Came defective out of the box (apron was ripped off and loads of screws missing). Needs a bit of intervention to restore. 2. Quality of material used suspect. Cheap plastic corners used..risk of breakage 3. Slowish surface....maybe a thicker table top assists with speed?
This product was extremely well packed. Upon arrival no chips, dents, or scratches on the product.  95% preassembled. Well made and sturdy We particularly like the ability to flip one side up to use for individual practice.  Because the table design has 2 independent halves, you can also use them for other purposes. We hesitated spending the money, but now know the product will last a very long time.
Most of the negative reviews are for damaged table. This could have happened in shipping or storage. As far as the table itself, there is NOTHING out there that comes close to this table for under $500. The advantage pro is an amazing 3/4 inch (19.05mm) table, competition size. We are very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend it.
I received this table from my family for my birthday. It is heavy and did require some help getting it down the basement. I was able to put the table up by myself. Flipping the table up after installing the casters would have been easier with another person but I was able to carefully do it myself. The two half's are balanced perfectly on the casters. It is very easy to move and store when not playing. The leg levelers are very handy. The net assembly is super easy. The manual is easy to understand. The blue color of the table looks great. I would recommend this table for the beginner all the way up to the professionals.
Had this table for a week now and enjoying playing on it every night.  Great table for home use.  It was delivered in a week as promised and placed in recreation room as I wanted, with a 30 minute heads up call so I could be there.  Took about 30 minutes to assemble with easy to follow instructions.  Need 2 people to assemble. Comes with very nice Stiga net. I have played on many tables during my 65 years of playing including several clubs.  This table is top notch for recreational home play.
First delivery was damaged, the shipper called us and told us that they werent even gonna bring it over. We called amazon in the middle of December, and they had a new one to us just in time for Christmas. It came virtually assembled, just had to put wheels on. Took a bit of effort to get down into the basement, but very happy with our purchase. High quality build, very easy to fold table halves up to roll away. Wheels lock in place easily. Heavy build, excellent ball action.
The STIGA Advantage Ping Pong table is a championship-style Ping Pong table.  If you want a legitimate/official table, this is the one for you.  It is of the highest quality - very sturdy, correct size,  strong net.  Additionally, it was very easy to assemble.  All you need to do is connect the 4 wheel brackets with included bolts/washers/nuts.  Use a wrench and a set of pliers to tighten the bolts all the way and you are good to go.  Table is very slick - the sides are separate and can both be folded up and wheeled around to conveniently move/tuck away if needed.  You can also practice by yourself with this table.  I actually have this table, this is not a paid review.  If you are shopping for a GOOD ping pong table, you found your guy.
I recently purchased the Stiga ping pong table for our man cave and everyone loves it!!  It arrived when they said it would, it was very easy to put together. We put it together in the garage and had to move it to basement and it rolled easy and set right back up.  Its very easy to put up the one side and play single. Buy this for hours of fun!!
We got the Advantage Lite table for our kids (9 and 6) for Christmas.  It was heavy, but we still were able to get it put together and operating in less than a half hour on Christmas Eve.  The next morning, we pretended that we just bought paddles and balls and had to play on the kitchen table.  The kids were excited about just that, but then I said, "Let's see if we can find something for a net downstairs," and BAM!  They saw the table!  It was great!  The table does bend in a little bit when the kids lean on it trying to reach a ball in the middle stuck at the net, so I don't know about this holding up long term.  However, for the price, it's probably the best starter table for the kids.  Very satisfied!
For the price this is a great buy. Came well packed and was easy to assemble. So far the experience has been great. Very easy to fold and stowaway. Will keep an eye on its long term performance.
I like the table very much but after opening we found this damage. Now the issue is the bulkiness of the table so we cannot return but I wanted to check if there is a way to fix this. Please help if you can
Recently purchased this table and totally pleased with purchase.  Assembly was a snap. the table is excellent quality and the bounce is truly amazing.  We have played on many ping pong tables and are truly impressed with the play of this one.  The Advantage Pro does cost a bit more than the Advantage, but for medium level players and above, I think you will see the difference.
My wife got this table for me as a wedding gift knowing how much I love to play ping pong. I play at work on our lunch break and the table we play on at work is crap compared to the Stiga Advantage Table that we purchased. Was extremely pleased with how easy it was to install in our house. The table separates into two main pieces and was fairly light to bring down the stairs into the basement. Once we got it into the basement it couldn't have been more than 15-20 minutes to have everything completely set up. The table itself is very sturdy and looks great. I'm by no means an expert ping pong player but for the price you're not going to find a better table than this. Looking forward to many years of playing on the beautiful table! Would certainly recommend this table to any family or friends.
We are having fun. This table was easy as advertised.it took a while to get and it was very heavy to get in. My daughter help me to assemble but I could have done alone. We are enjoying it.
After assembling it, I noticed there is a major defect on a surface. It is not made during delivery. On the back, there is a hole that I suspect made the defect. In addition, I noticed a different screw were used. I believe the manufacture should have noticed this defect. Pretty disappointed! Other than this defect, product itself looks good. I'm going to ask replace it, but it seems tricky to ask replacement for such big items. :(
I am beginner in ping-pong. I played occasionally at my work place. I like the packaging, stability and easy folding function and delivery.
This table is better than expected. It was delivered right on time by a very professional crew who brought the table to my garage, exactly where I wanted it. It was very easy to assemble as the only thing that was not fully assembled were the wheels. Instructions were very easy to follow. It comes with a net which is very easy to attach to the table as well. Once put together, the table is very stable and great to play on. We had friends and neighbors on the first night of having the table and everyone was very impressed. After you are done, you can fold the table to a very manageable size and can easily roll it to wherever you want to keep it. Due to a small size, it fits in front of the car in a small garage. Very good quality for the price you pay for this.
Good table. Very sturdy and rolls nicely. Easy to assemble. I would get the Advantage Pro model if I could do it again. The playing surface could have a better feel to it, i.e. the feel of the bounce action could be better. That extra 3+mm would assuredly be a noticeable improvement to me. I don't think the average person would have anything bad to say about this table. I just really wanted a professional feel without breaking the bank. For the extra $100 I would definitely upgrade.
So Santa brought my boys a Stiga Ping Pong table for Christmas. Product was easy to assemble and only took about 10 minutes. You will need a wrench (6mm) for assembly... The sides of the table do not connect. You just push them together and lock the wheels so it won't move. I'm unsure how great this works on a hard surface, but it works fine in our bonus room which has carpet. The box is HEAVY... Be prepared. If moving the table without taking it out of the box you will need some additional help. The table is lot easier to manipulate when it is removed from the box. You will enjoy this table... Merry Christmas
We love this ping pong table. So easy to set up. And it doesnt take much room to store. Already we have had hours of fun with the table. Excellent choice on our part.
Good table. Assembly was easy. Casters hold the table well on my linoleum floor, and playing surface is very nice. There's a little trick to folding/unfolding the table halves, but it folds up very quickly, and the wheels move it easily.
Have only had the table for about a month and have used it about a dozen times.  The table is very sound and is holding up well.  Had one minor problem with a stripped lock nut but it was easily replaced at my local hardware store.  It's fun to have when the grand daughters show up or my wife and I have a half hour or so to relax with a few ping pong games.
Really like this table, it was super easy to set up and the quality seems to be good. The deck of the table plays well and its very sturdy for being two separate pieces. The only thing I would like is if the halves where just a little higher for single playing. The height is OK but could be a challenge for taller and beginner users.
The table pieces are solidly built and packaged well.  Sometime during delivery, the outer packaging took a noticeable beating, with chunks of the cardboard ripped and damaged.  Inside, though, there was no damage to the table components itself, thanks to the reinforced packaging they used.  It was easy to put together: just use the bolts provided to fasten the legs to each table half, stand them upright, and clamp the net in the middle.  The instructions were minimal, but easy enough to follow.  The table itself provides a nice bounce, and takes ball spin pretty well.  I really like the clean look of it too.  It's easy to set upright for storage and wheel around.  I recommend it for anyone looking to add a table to their home.
I did some research in terms of affordable tennis tables and i'm more than happy with my STIGA choice. It took literally 10 minutes for me and my father-in-law to assemble this table in my basement before we started playing. Pleasantly surprised by the quality. Let alone the looks! Done playing? Fold it and roll it away and it almost does not take up any space. It turns out that my kids love playing ping pong even more than i do. Finally something that helps me get them off their iphones/ipads. Highly recommend for family fun!
We've had the table for nearly a week and have been very pleased thus far. My 9-year old and I put it together, although I would recommend a second adult that can help maneuver things into position. It requires a little bit of space to assemble, as you have to lay the box flat and then remove at least one of the halves and also place it flat on the floor. Other than bolting the legs onto the table and securing the net, there really is nothing else to assemble. We were playing within 45 minutes of trying to slide the box into position in the basement. It is quite heavy and stable, folds up quickly, and rolls very easily. We've played together and I have also left one half raised and practiced alone. I considered others that were nearly twice the price but I'm glad this was the ultimate choice.
I bought this for my son and his wife for Christmas.  They love it.  They already had people over for a ping pong tournament.  Very nice quality. :)
This is a great table; everything is solid and the wood is high quality.  It makes for an extremely playable surface.  It arrived in good condition, easy packaging, and it was a breeze to setup ... took me just a few minutes.  Love the color too.  Looks and plays like a professional table, for a fraction of the cost.  We've been playing on this for about a week now, with the kids and friends, and everyone has enjoyed it.
Wonderful product.  Shipped in a very sturdy thick box with no damage.  Install was easy, needed 2 sets of hands for the last step.  It is fairly heavy, but that's great in my opinion.  The color is brilliant, the quality of all the components is to notch.  The fact that you can separate the pieces and use as 2 side tables for entertaining is great.  They nestle great and out of the way when we need it as well. It is a full size table and needs a very large space to be able to use it.  5'x9' is huge, but you will need space (4') on each end to make sure you can move and play. Kids love it and will be a great indoor activity.  We are using ours on a carpet floor with no issues.
I ordered this table for our 8 and 9 year old daughters.  The delivery process was very frustrating as the initial arrival date was pushed back and the item was not able to be tracked, but it did eventually arrive.  The package showed some wear, but the table was mostly unharmed inside.  There were a few loose screws, but the tabletop was perfect.  The assembly was very simple, but required 2 adults.  I like how the table is in 2 separate pieces for easy moveability around the house if needed.  Each side is also light enough (in the LITE version of the table) for 2 adults to carry if necessary.  We love the blue color of the table, and it plays well for our family.
My wife and mother-in-law assembled the table completely. While it may be helpful to have a 3rd to help flip the 2 sides over, they were able to complete it with minor hassle. This table is well-made. Seems like they've thought through all the little details:  It's able to be leveled, all the wheels lock in place, the net can be tightened well, the corners have plastic edge guards to keep them from being dinged. Highly recommend it. I can see why it has such great reviews.
I debated on buying this table vs spending more on a higher end table.  I bought this one about a month ago, and I'm very happy with the purchase.  It is a super heavy table, great quality.  It took 10-15 minutes from opening the box to being ready to play, very simple setup.  It folds up nicely for storage.  I keep in in our unheated garage - I live in Minnesota where it's frequently below zero in the winter.  I turn up the heat in the garage when we want to play - so far no issues with the extreme temps - the table has held up amazingly well.  If you're looking for a great deal on a family table - I'd say there's no reason at all to spend more than this - awesome table and awesome value.
The table is very heavy & it's a two person job. The table is great quality & works exactly as I wanted it to. We don't move it out of the way very often, but it is easy to do. Highly recommended if you want a good ping pong table.
I searched a long time for the perfect table for our family.  After reading reviews, we went with the STIGA Advantage Competition table.  The minimal assembly required only took a few minutes and was very straight forward.  This is an extremely sturdy table that looks fantastic in our house.  Though we just received it, I am confident that it will bring us years of enjoyment.  Stop looking, and purchase this table today.  You wont be disappointed.
The quality is very good.  Went together easily following the instructions provided.  Using the leveling leg adjustments makes the table sturdy.  We unpacked the table and before any assembly moved half at a time to our basement family room then assembled.  We turned each half upside down on another table while assembling the legs, then it was easy to turn it over and set it up.  Net is designed to tighten easily after assembly.  Our children and grand children were impressed and enjoyed the table at Christmas time.  Would certainly recommend this table.
This ping pong table has been greatly used over the holidays. It is sturdy, nice-looking and the ONLY downside was my own fault - that if not measuring how BIG it would be. It fit the room but wow - it is huge!!!
