Its a great and dependable little speaker, doesnt get too loud but that is to be expected for a speaker of this size. The only drawback (as another reviewer noted) is the fact that it makes a sound every time it powers on, connects to Bluetooth, and shuts down, so if you are using it to listen to something to fall asleep to, be aware that it will make a jarring sound when it turns itself off. This is a reasonable feature, but it would be nice if you could disable it if you wanted. Other than that, the speaker is great.
My own speaker to carry everywhere. Sounds great, the battery lasts long and for my personal use to connect my mobile and computer it's very useful. Easy to carry in any purse. Bluetooth has a great reception from far. I simply love it!!!
Im 72 and lost the highs in my hearing but with the JBL speaker  next to me when Im watching my TV the sound and clarity is perfect for me to understand  The voices and the JBL speaker is loud for its size.
This is a very good bluetooth speaker. Maybe the best I've heard at this size. You can actually hear clear bass notes. After purchasing this one, I'm giving my old one away. Don't think I can do much better than this in a speaker of this size .
I've had a tough few days, and this little speaker is just what I needed. It's small, feels nice to hold, but the sound is beautiful. I needed some bass for my own vocal practice, and it has pretty good bass for something so small. The sound is clear even at a very high volume. Fingers crossed for a good battery life.
It's a pretty good product. At the price point, it exceeds expectations, but it isn't as good as Bose Microlink. If sound quality is important to you, I'd go with Bose.
This is smaller than expected but dont let size fool you! This little speaker delivers big sound. The quality is great and I love how its easy to just throw in my bag and take it where ever I go and want my tunes. Worth every penny! Plus the battery life is great on this.
Wanted a speaker to travel anywhere and this one fits the bill. The sound is great, not top of the line great, but to be honest I'm using it while working in the yard and around the house, so I don't notice the nuances in sound that a couple of the reviews referred to. I don't know how long the charge last, but I normally have it on for the majority of the day and it's still going when I turn it off. All in all it was a great purchase and I would recommend it to others.
I am extremely satisfied with this little speaker!  It has great sound quality and was really easy to use!!  It connects so easily. Also, it came in cool colors!  Also, came early in perfect packaging!
I live in a one bedroom apartment and this little speaker is perfect!  I can have it playing in one room and still hear the music in another room.  It's small but mighty.  The clarity is not as great as if the music was coming directly from my phone.  But for $32 I'm very happy.
A small, attractive Bluetooth Speaker. Connected easily and sounded reasonable for such a small speaker. Not a lot of amplification, but adequate for iPhone or iPad  use. Battery lasted about three hours at  medium volume. Charged battery and used it again for about five minutes. Speaker worked OK. The next time I tried to use it, it was dead - no indicator lights, etc. I tried to charge it and nothing happened, either. I tried a factory reset, which did nothing. No suggestions on the Internet made any difference. After working with it for about one hour, I threw it in the trash, very disappointed with a JBL Product, as I have used their stereo equipment for many years. Don't waste your money or time with this product.
Integrity product impressive, the only issue I have as a professional veteran musician drummer & drum technician since 5 years of age is there isn't enough "high end frequency". Low end bass frequency is quite adequate & satisfactory in my humble honest opinion, lastly the 2nd issue I have with this product is there's no Linking Two together that's honestly disappointing, possible the technicians at JBL could implement this feature in this product!? "Please" & thank you immensely unmeasurably then it would be really something very special and impressive even more so respectfully humbly kindly I say that, two is a good sounding thing. Kind humble regardz,
easy to set up with bluetooth, good sound, waterproof, answers phone calls, and has a mic. Very compact, put it in your jacket pocket. Works for me, I haven't used other portable speakers, so don't have much to offer in comparison to other portable speakers. I'm sure there are others with better bass or better than, if you are such an audiophile,  but come on this is $28 for having around and anywhere. The only issue if there are any: the control buttons aren't raised much, so might be difficult for some to feel them, but there are only 5 of them on the top of that cube, so you know where they are. I originally got it for my Mom, so for her, the tactile part of it would make it difficult to operate this player.
I just love this little speaker... I bring it from room to room with me so I have my music for when I'm showering, getting ready, cooking, or on a cleaning spree. It gets LOUD and the sound quality is great. The connectivity is perfect, I turn it on and it instantly connects to my phone to play music. Plus, the battery life is amazing. I use it for hours each day, and only charge it every few days... it has yet to quit on me when I need it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, you can't beat this for the price. I also have the Clip one to take golfing with me. I'm a believer in JBL speakers. It's quality on a budget.
This is my fourth bluetooth speaker. I also have a JBL flip which obviously have better sound. But this small speaker was available for a price below $20 and I couldn't resist the temptation. And I am glad I gave it a go. It is splashproof to a great extent. Audiobooks sound very well. Not a 'treat to the ears' for audiophiles who wants to listen to music through it. But for $20 it is absolutely worth it. Charge lasts really long. I have used it for more than 5 hours before I put it on charge again. But it was just me being over-cautious. The speaker did not show any symptom of going out of charge. Phone calls are also ok via the in-built microphone. Bluetooth connectivity is easy and fast. Range is pretty good. Build is solid.Can be slipped inside a trouser pocket. I would recommend it for a travel speaker. Only if there was a loop or clip-ribbon provided in the box, it would be a cherry on top.
I haven't had much luck with small speakers.  I'm usually too cheap to buy a quality one and they never last or have poor sound quality.  This speaker ticks all the right boxes for me.  It was relatively cheap and puts out good quality sound.  It sync's easily with our devices.  I like that the volume control matches the volume controls on my cell phone.  Other speakers that I've had often have separate controls, so if I don't turn up the volume on the device, then you cannot hear much out of the speaker.  This speaker works seamlessly with my devices, which I wasn't expecting.  Although it is waterproof, I haven't actually showered with it.  It does seem to be fairly well sealed up, so I'm sure that it would be fine in the shower.  I just don't want to mess up a good thing and I'm good without testing out that feature.
I wanted a portable bluetooth speaker for my 5-year-old MacBook Pro. I did not want to spend hundreds to replace the speaker because my computer still has a few years left before I buy a new one. I had no idea what to buy so I turned to my favorite teachers, Amazon and Google. Google helped me with the selection and Amazon had it in stock. The sound is fantastic! The ease of use is absolutely, well, easy! I didn't need any instructions...just plugged one end into the speaker and the other end into my Mac and activated it in my system and glorious sound resulted. It turns itself off when not in use, which I found surprising. I am pretty damn happy with myself because I did not need to call any of my grandsons!!
This product is a rip off. The battery life was trash, it didn't come with a charger, the sound quality was definitely not JBL, and IT BROKE 5 DAYS AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRED. I have officially owned this speaker 2 months and 5 days and it is already going in the trash. I used it this morning to play some music. Charged it. I came back this afternoon and it won't turn on.
we're using this as a shower speaker (as in literally in the shower, on a caddy with our shampoos and shower gels and such). it has clear, loud audio that can easily be heard over the water and extractor fan (and through the door into the next room, so be aware of that when setting the volume), connects quickly and easily via bluetooth, and has absolutely absurd battery life. with whatever juice it had out of the box, we were able to use it for almost two and a half months before it needed a charge! and even then, it was just the low battery warning light - it hadn't actually died yet.
Great little waterproof speaker with awesome sound for its size and price. One issue Ive had is the battery doesnt last super long. The only other small problem is the thing has so much bass it will vibrate off of almost any surface if you arent carful. You have to make sure to build a barrier around it to keep it from falling. Regardless of these two small issues I do not regret my purchase and would definitely purchase another one.
Love this speaker. I bought one for daughters and I ended up getting myself one too. The sound is great. The battery last more than 5 hours. I am using it in my office everyday and Im sure I listen it more than 5 hours a day. I only charged it every other day. Worth the money!
I'm so pleased with this little speaker.  I purchased it to use as sleeping music (tranquil) and also to motivating music while getting ready in the mornings.  It's loud enough to hear music throughout my whole 2 bedroom apartment, although I have a full entertainment system for my place.  This speaker fits my needs perfectly.  Battery lasts over 8 hours!  So glad I chose this speaker over others.
I bought the orange but it really looks like red which made me really sad.  Sound quality is okay, not amazing.  I really cannot press the volume buttons with my finger, I had to use my nails and I really didnt like that. It probably going to get hole over there. I dont think that it worth for 40$ Update/ it says free return, but you need to GO TO KOHL STORE FOR A FREE RETURN. Ridiculous man. Such a disappointment
WOW! I am impressed! Even with my hearing aids, I just couldn't hear the sound from my laptop, cellphone or tablet. Now, I am able to enjoy music, videos and even Zoom meetings. It's worth it's weight in gold and I'd definitely buy it again.
The size of this speaker was much smaller than what I thought I saw online. I reluctantly connected it to my phone by Bluetooth. I was Amaaazed by the BIG sound and Quality coming from such a small speaker. I would definitely try other products from JBL in the future. The battery life is good and the connectivity was seamless
I plugged it in to charge and came back after a couple hours. The red light was permanently on and the speaker would not turn on and would not respond. It does nothing now. Whether I leave it plugged in or not, it is useless. If you want an expensive paperweight, by all means, spend a lot of money for a paper weight. But if you want a speaker, I would recommend literally any other bluetooth speaker in the world other than this one.
Works great, I would totally buy another. I will say that I primarily use it at home while cleaning or cooking so I am always near a power source. The battery life doesnt last longer than 3.5 hrs for me. So I am always recharging. Doesnt hinder my listening because I can listen and charge at the same time.  Again ~ its little but had a great sound!!!
Love it so much I recommended it to a friend who purchased an orange one. Great sound, portable, plug in to charge and use at the same time.  Love the color selections and price.
I cant tell you how much I love this little speaker. Its amazing the sound that comes from it. It really projects. I purchased it to use when Im away for a Bluetooth speaker and to use at the beach. What a wonderful purchasing a great price
I loved this speaker. I was a little on the fence because of the price, but I used it during a cruise and it sounded excellent and the fact that it's water proof makes showering a lot more entertaining! Hang out by pool side with this nice speaker if you don't want to bother the neighbors! Highly recommended!
I like the color and size the most bc it matches the shower and takes up very little space. Best part is it sound great. It has a nice base and clarity. It's greatly! Plus Super easy to Bluetooth connect. Just press the button.
An excellent little speaker with great sound! Easy to use, I bought it for my husband so he could listen to music while he worked. He loves it. He uses it at home when he watches movies on the iPad as well. I would highly recommend it & a great value for a good price!
Great little speaker, sound is amazing..............however, it is LITERALLY sitting on top of my iPad and cannot stay connected. It worked great for the first 2-3 weeks, now I have to continue to connect it at least 2-3 times a day. Working in the restaurant industry, music in the kitchen is a MUST! Having to stop what you are doing, and connect the speaker is a pain. I have several JBL products and this little joker is by far the worst I have ever owned.
This is really cute in red, has a very nice finish and will be great for outside activities. The sound is pretty good but not as good as the cylinder-shaped portable speakers. Still, good product for the price.
I am very impressed by this cute little speaker! Also, the sale price was a great deal! I like how the speaker makes specific sounds when it turns on/off and when it is Bluetooth connected. The quality is excellent, and I would buy this again as a gift.
Best speaker ever. It's a nice small size to put in your pocket. This little speaker has huge sound it amazes me every time like how something this small can has such outstanding quality it's awesome. And it's awesome for the people who created this they are genius. The bass on this speaker is mad crazy too. This is the best speaker I ever purchase will definitely be ordering more. I strongly recommend.
This speaker is perfect! Its just a bit bigger than your palm. Mine fits right in my hand perfectly! The sound is amazing. I used a equalizer and played with some settings and this speaker did great overall! The bass is perfect for as small of a speaker that it is and the overall sound quality and loudness is great as well! If your looking for a great, durable, waterproof, loud speaker than look no further!
This thing was so little!  But I love it and Im cloning to buy another one for my bedroom. Its doesnt go super loud but really its loud enough. Im not super picky about sound quality but its decent. You cant beat the price. Also connecting to my phone is seamless and fast!
Bought  this for a 13 year old who wanted a much more high end, larger speaker. I liked the price of this for a young teen as well as the size. I was a little worried when ordering hoping it wasnt too small and sound quality was good. As with most JBL products, this does not disappoint!! The size is perfect for her as she likes to carry it around with her. Its sturdy, easy to use and the sound is great! Considered ordering another.
Sounds blown, last maybe 30 mins in battery
I didnt read into this speaker well I should have though its too small if youre into small speaker boxes then its only about 3x3 maybe Its not worth the money at all maybe ok for the shower or small room.
My radio went out in my van. I cant afford a new system so I got this. I can take this speaker anywhere no problem. It holds a charge it allows me to answer my calls connect blue tooth. I luv it. Good shipping also
This is a pretty good speaker, if you are buying it for the right use. If youre looking for a small speaker to say, listen to while in the shower, this is perfect. If youre looking for something to provide sound outdoors, or on the river, this is probably underpowered. Its still a great speaker and worth its price for sure,  but its not meant to be a party sound system.
This radio is great. It's loud while in the shower and the case, bought separately, makes you feel it is pretty well covered and protected. We have been enjoying this great buy.
I have been seeing people with the pill one and I love how loud it was but I didnt want it that big when I saw this one I knew I wanted to get it for its size because its perfect for traveling. The moment I cut it on I was blown away. I did not expect so much power from this little  box lol. It is amazing!! It bumps so hard you can feel the vibrations of each beat of the song I love it. Do not underestimate this bad boy!!! I also love that it automatically cuts off when idle after awhile.
It stopped working about 5 months in. Stopped taking a charge and connecting. I have other jbl speakers and none of them have done this. Its probably fake
Was very surprised by this little speaker. I got a few for Christmas gifts and ended up with an extra so I kept it for myself. It sounds better than my Marley Liberate portable speaker. Very crisp and has pretty decent base. Its a little powerhouse!
I love this little speaker. I literally had it paired and working in minutes. My favorite purchase in a long time! I gave 5 stars on being waterproof but I dont really know as I havent had it around water. Just wanted to give it the highest rating I could!
I understand that this bluetooth speaker is cheap but wow. Sound quality is very poor, constantly lost bluetooth connectivity (after it finally syncs after 10 minutes of trying), won't stay powered on when plugged in, not very loud, no bass. JBL should be ashamed of this product. If you're looking for a cheap, small bluetooth speaker, you're still better off getting an even cheaper, off brand one than this. Terrible.
Use this For listening to my audible  books. I like That it shuts off on its own if you havent used it for about 15 minutes. The battery only takes less than two hours to recharge and it can be used for about 6 to 8 hours.
I use this when I take a shower and it works very well. Can be very loud for its size. Sound quality is definitely there with this, haven't had any problem connecting with Bluetooth. Although I do wish there was a way to set a password to connect it. I've had cheaper products come with that feature and its awesome because if someone steals it they can't use it. Definitely recommend this.
For the size and price, the sound is amazing!  Im really particular about the quality of the music I listen to, and this little JBL certainly lives up to the brand reputation for deep, quality sound!  I use it every day and I love it!!!  My only wish is that the battery life was a bit longer or that it gave more notice for low battery...
This little speaker is probably the best bang for your buck!!! Sounds great, doesnt hit hard on bass but i listen to country and some house music and it works for me on the river!!!! I hook it up to a solar power charger after it has been fully charged and coast the river !!!! Works the entire 4 hours and its still has battery left! Great sound to put in your room as well. And also good to jame our on my buddies boat since his radio is messed up
It's pretty loud. There are many different colors and it has a sleek design. The buttons are easy to press, and the audio is crystal clear. It lasts such a long time and it takes a while for me to need to charge it again. The small design is very portable and it's waterproof. You can use it in the shower, I'd still be mindful of where you place it though (preferably somewhere high). I came from Flossy Carter's review and I wasn't disappointed.
I bought this because I listed to music in the shower. I keep it on a small ledge - no direct water contact other than regular splatter. I was most concerned about leaving the device in my shower at all time (it's it sole purpose - shower music!) and having the steam damage it over time... No problem at all after months of use! Also - I use it with my apple watch - works like a charm - Bluetooth does not disconnect. Battery life is also great.
I bought this item to stick in the shower so I could listen to music while getting ready. I was hesitant at first even though it says its waterproof. It ended up getting soaked and worked great. The sound quality is actually pretty decent. The volume gets loud enough so you can hear it perfectly. If you like to vibe out and listen to music while getting ready you need this speaker in your life.
It just arrived and I am super impressed! It's much smaller than I was expecting. I am not disappointed though. I can tuck this into any bag and jam out like I have no regard for anyone elses ears! It was so easy to connect to, comes with a cute 6" charging cord. Maybe it's 5"? Who knows, might have been lied to my whole life. I am super happy with this purchase. I'm excited to see how long the charge lasts and if it's water proof and how the sound quality holds up against a curious toddler who likes to play with all the things.
This is a great Bluetooth speaker for small get-togethers or if youre listening to music in your room, in the shower, etc. The sound quality is good. Its crisp and clear at low to mid volumes and it gets plenty loud for such a small speaker. Ive experienced some clipping and distortion when its turned up to max volume, but really if you want it to be that loud then youre better off with a bigger speaker. Its perfect for its intended use and great for the price. Battery life is okay, I spent about three to four hours playing magic the gathering with my buddies while this thing was running and I never needed to charge it. Its definitely worth the price, if you want a cheap and portable speaker you can throw around a little bit then dont hesitate on this one.
I ordered this speaker six weeks ago. I was impressed with the sound quality and volume out of such a small speaker and thought it was perfect. However, in the six weeks I've had it, the Bluetooth connectivity has not been consistent. For five days, it will not pair with either my phone or my laptop, making it a decent paperweight but not a speaker. I've tried every fix suggested by various tech support services. I also purchased JBL Bluetooth headphones six weeks ago and had the same problem. When they work, they are great but they have not been reliable and go out for days at a time. JBL, I hope this isn't a product/company wide problem and hope to continue to be a customer.
Love everything about it. Its small so you will not get the Bose or the JBL 3 sound or volume if thats what youre looking for but the sounds are crisp and clear. Its great if youre  looking for something small and portable that will fit in your pocket. I connect it to my mini projector when I visit relatives; everyone could hear the movie even with some chatters in the room.
Bought it for when I'm driving a bus empty to Pittsburgh. Love this little thing! It has good sound for how small it is! I highly recommend this for situations where you can't use ear buds or headphones!
Im in a family of 4, we each have our own JBL speaker. I got this one for my boyfriend for Christmas, the sound is amazing! Its water proof too! He loves it!
Nice sound for the money. I love how convenient it is to take with. Very sturdy and doesn't feel like I'm going to break it when I throw it in a backpack.
Bought this for Christmas for my husband to replace his old JBL speaker. Hes very happy with it. works great smaller than his other one. the sound is fantastic no problems definitely a great buy.
I read all the reviews on this before buying and everyone loved it, we have enjoyed it for the most part. The problem is the battery life. We do not make it 2 hours and it shuts down. I wouldnt buy this one again.
Outstanding product with unexpectedly good sound quality for such a small and convenient speaker.  Very clear sound; highly recommended!
So far, so good! Haven't tested for  water resistant and don't plan to,  and we'll see how well the battery does....hopefully  better than the other  one we had (different brand)!
Absolutely love this product! I bought this for my boyfriend because his old speaker sounded terrible! This speaker is very light weight, you can fit it in your pocket or a small bag! The sound is very clear and if your wanting loud music, its great! Sounds awesome and the price is great for the great quality, highly recommend!
I was a little skeptical buying this speaker bec its so small but knowing that JBL is such a reputable company and the price was so amazing I bought it anyway and Im so happy I did!! *pro tip buy a case for it that has a clip so you can clip it to your bag and walk around with music!! -enjoy!!
Great little speaker. Definitely worth the price. Only flaw I have is that it will occasionally disconnect from the phone and turn itself off even tho it still has battery life. This problem happens every once in a while, not too often to where Id think about returning it. Its Perfect for the work day outdoors.
Could not believe this was a JBL speaker. Very muddy, all mid-range and bass, little if any treble. Have to return. Too bad because form and size are nice, and Bluetooth works seamlessly.  Maybe I got a dud.
Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Wow awesome little speaker its really good it packs a punch! Jbl is a great brand I dont know about the batter life I just got it today but Ill come back and do an update!!
Going to keep it short. This speaker is very convenient and nice. This sound quality is crystal clear and the bass is impressive! Bought this because of the reviews, definitely trust the reviews! Im happy I got it. I got the champagne color
My Sony portable finally gave out, and I didnt want to spend $$$ on a new one. With so many options and mixed reviews, I decided to give this one a try. JBL does not disappoint. Bass is legit, and even metal sounds good.
This JBL speaker is Amazing!! My husband loved it so much that I ordered a second one for him. He absolutely loves the sound he gets from this small speaker and also how easy it is to use!! I would definitely recommend the JBL speaker for anyone to buy!! You won't be disappointed!!
Bought this speaker because my girlfriend and I spend a lot of time on the beach, camping, in our canoe, in the woods - lots of moist places, so I wanted a speaker that could get damp without crapping out on me.  Connection is simple, battery life is great, and it's very portable - but heavy enough so you feel confident that it's not a POS!  I wish it would get louder, but I won't lose a star simply because of my preference (Heavy Metal can NEVER be loud enough!!).  Highly recommend it.
I purchased this as a gift and my friend says it works beautifully.  It seems very sturdy and is heavier than other speakers I've looked at.  Great for packing for a trip and taking it to the beach.
This little guy has a lot of sound for its size! Love the color range, great sound and compact for travel. This is a great speaker to own. Its also one of JBLs cheaper speakers but still has their quality sound.
I bought this to use while out gardening. It does the job. I also use it while cleaning. It gets loud enough for me to jam out but not too loud so that the rest of the house can't hear their TVs. The color is cute and the size is perfect. Would recommend gifting!
Definitely a very nice little speaker. JBL has been around for a long time, so speaker quality on all levels (sound quality, battery life, bluetooth connection) is very good for price! 5-stars!
I bought this as a bathroom speaker. I needed a speaker that is waterproof and sounds good. So far, JBL is doing its job. The bass sound is great. I also have no problem connecting it to my devices. Because Im only using it in the bathroom, the battery life lasts at least a month or more. I highly recommend this speaker
Bought this one for the wife at work,  she loves it!!! The sound quality is amazing for this size. Super easy to set up bluetooth. All controls connect to your phone.
I wanted a smaller speaker for around the house and for some travel. It has good battery life, and solid sound.  I use it mostly for listening to podcasts and makes listening around the house much easier.  Even if my iPhone is low and I need to charge it, I can play and listen while my iPhone is charging. It has a solid feel to it and I think it look cool too.
I have only a couple of days using it so I'm not able to say that is durable or something like that. It sounds pretty good, minty, they are not so loud but maaaaan they have a great bass for the size. Not tested with water yet, maybe later. Can't say much about the battery life, the longest time turned on and firing music has been like 2 hours. I haven't let them discharged yet. Overall, I'm very happy with it.
For a small speaker this has great sound! This speaker is about the size of my hand so if you are looking for something you can hear throughout your house, you will need to pick something bigger. I use it in the bathroom so I can say that it is moisture resistant. I wouldnt say its waterproof. I connect my phone to this speaker on the daily while I shower and I can usually use it several days in a row before I have to charge it again. I would totally recommend this speaker for a college dorm!
Ive been a consistent customer of Bose for years, denying that any other speaker quality would come close to anything Bose could produce.  I was wrong.  I thought Id experiment and bought this little speaker for my boat. This little bugger not only is loud, but the sound quality is impressive! In such a small, rugged and waterproof case.  I live it!  I went ahead and bought my daughter a JBL flip!
This isn't HiFi obviously. It still sounds pretty incredible for its size though! You can tell the sound gets a little bit compressed and is not full range, but this little box will not distort your sound! Even when the volume is cranked to 100%. The bass response is far better than I expected.  It gets about as loud as the average raised/yelling voice. I estimate 76-80db. Perfect for rides in the front pocket of my bike bag! I can even hear it over the highway traffic!
For such a small speaker, this unit delivers surprisingly good sound. Thanks to the compact design you have it with you everywhere and I love it thanks to the fact that it is protected against moisture even while I shower my favorite music to be able to listen to it. Would thus buy this device (is also already my second) at any time again.
I have been looking for a small Bluetooth speaker that does not sound like a tin can for some time now. I have to say that I am very impressed with this JBL GO2 in regard to size and sound ratio. The speaker is small enough to fit in your hand but easily fills the room. I live in a small studio apartment that is roughly 450 sq ft and I can hear it clearly in any corner of my space. I enjoy taking this speaker with me to work as well which is a large, open warehouse event space. Even there it sounds really clear and crisp. If you do a little poking around on the internet you can find that there are different frequency modes as well that enhance the low and high ends. The battery life is great. It does take about 2 hours to fully charge so I usually charge it after using it each time to cut down on having to wait the full 2 hours. I am looking forward to trying this out in a water setting once quarantine is over. TL;DR - this speaker is a great value for the size and sound!
This little speaker is the best I have found for late night TV viewing and not disturbing those sleeping. I bought a Bose a while back, great sound if you like only bass, but way to much bass that drowns out the treble completely when the volume is turned down. I'll give the Bose to someone who appreciates rattling windows. At age 92, boom is not my friend.
Never knew a portable JBL Speaker could be this loud and lots of Bass. Charges fast and very sleek to carry around in jacket pocket. Connects to the iphone Bluetooth very fast and easy. Great speaker for listening to music.
Super easy setup and great sound for a fantastic price.  And from such a reputable speaker maker.  I have other JBL products in my home so I knew what they could but amazed what they packed into this little speaker.  Highly recommend and may order another one for other spots around the house.
I wanted to buy a pocket-size quality speaker and this does the job. You can feel the high quality of the materials, the sound is amazing for its size and it has a bass as well. One thing that they can add is a space to attach the speaker because it lacks one. Literally it is not possible to attach it to anything but put it on over something. I will be looking for a case that can do the job i guess. Other than that the speaker is amazing.
I wasn't sure what to expect, but this sounds really good and works well with an iPhone8. Connects immediately, and doesn't sound tinny. It's loud, too, so if you want to hear music while you're taking a shower, you can leave it on the counter. Very pleased with this purchase.
I got it for the shower & its the perfect size, it doesn't take up too much space. I love JBL speakers, ive owned multiple & this one is good quality just like the rest.
These speakers are powerful little dudes.  I bought these for my nephews for Christmas and they packed a powerful punch when they used them.  Great buy!!!!
For the size, the sound quality is impressive!  I primarily use this for work since my laptop speakers are trash.  Battery life does well and so far Bluetooth hasn't had any issues, also it is easy to connect.
I love this!  I don't know why I didn't get one sooner!  Fits in the palm of my hand, so I can easily throw it in my purse.  Awesome sound quality!  I 10000% recommend this product!!!!!
Good sound quality for such a small speaker. Enough to fill a dorm room. The bass does sound pretty good. Does better with rap and pop music than orchestral music(still sounds good) Jazz music sounds clear for the most part. The price increased by $10 from my last purchase, I only paid $30. Small and light, perfect for carrying along.
The sound quality on this tiny speaker is pretty awesome. Worth the buy.
The sound quality is so clear and it gets louder than my Bose color soundlink. The base could be a bit deeper but the speaker is so small it is what it is. Easy to connect. I was just so surprised what it could do! Portability for how loud it is is just perfect to me. If you need a speaker for a professional kitchen itd be great. Would by again 
For $29.95 you cant beat this!! Great tiny speaker. Very impressed. Compared it side-by-side to my Bose Soundlink and obviously the Bose was warmer and had more bass, but this little guy held its own and its water proof and tiny enough to carry in you pocket or bike pouch or dry bag for kayaking or boating. Highly recommended if you want a nice quality BT speaker that can go anywhere.
FYI I added the black silicone trimming. Well, it's only the first day, the sound quality is ok, but I'm spoiled, I'm comparing it too my 7 watt Bose soundlink which was more than double the price.  It goes back to the old saying, you pay for what you get. Overall not bad tho.
this is a small perfect speaker for small spaces: living room, bedroom, bathroom, etc. the sound doesn't get muffled or bad as you turn the volume all the way up. this is the best speaker i've bought for the price.
I got this for my bathroom. I love jammin out in the shower...who doesn't? I was pleasantly surprised by how loud it was in comparison to just using my phone's speaker. When a call comes in, the person can hear me in the shower and I can hear them perfectly too. Podcasts...no problem. Can hear it all!
Correction, the battery died and doesn't hold a charge, less than  1 hours of play.  The device doesn't like my charger.  Not very loud.  I've had to reset the device a few times, and had to watch videos in Tagalog to figure out how to reset, and I don't speak Tagalog.  I wish I could return this POS, but the Amazon deadline ended one day before.
I use this speaker to play music while i'm getting ready/in the shower/just hanging around my apartment/entertaining a small group of friends and it is perfect for that purpose! It gets louder than you think and this thing is unbreakable! It accidentally fell off my two story balcony while listening one night and hit the ground hard. It still worked perfectly and only got a minor scratch! The bluetooth connectoin is easy to manage, and haven't had any issues with it dropping connection etc. My only complaint is you can't charge it and listen at the same time when it dies, but the battery lasts awhile so you won't find that it dies too quickly.
Es mucho mas de lo que se puede esperar de una bocina de ese tamao. Excelente
The sound quality is pretty good for the size. Expected a little better sound from JBL but not really at this price point. Enjoyable sound outside though. Battery life is all I need but I only use for a couple of hours at a time. I have enjoyed this little speaker. And any bigger would make it too difficult to carry like I do. Overall, I'd recommend for outdoor mobility when headphones are not useable.
With a famous brand like JBL, you know the sound must be good, and it is! With the size of two cigarettes packs side-by-sise, it is much smaller than I thought. Regardless of size, the sound is rich, and full; not tin can'ish. Overall, for the price, it can't be beat! Connect to a Bluetooth device easily. Recommended.
I love how great the sound quality is for something that can fit in the palm of your hand. I was actually very suprised. It is waterproof too. I use it in the shower every morning and so far so good. Battery life is pretty good. Id say at least 6 hours. It does not let you know that its low but the light will turn red as opposed to white when the battery is low. I didn't want to spend $100 on a speaker when i usually use earbuds so if you are the same i reccommend this speaker.
I bought this for my daughter to use at her workplace as we currently have one that we use at home and love the sound quality. After using her jbjbll go 2 a couple of times she went to charge it and it would not charge up. She brought it home to charge using the charger for our existing speaker but it still would not power up. I will probably purchase another one for her but at a local electronics store where our first one was purchased at as it is not worth my time to mail the unit back to be repaired.
This little speaker packs a punch! The sound is awesome. I carry it all over the place - inside and out. I wish the battery lasted a little longer but it is really portable. I love it!
Ok, so I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little intoxicated at the moment, but this needs to be said. I was chilling with my brother, living that quarentine life and I was blasting some Yung Gravy. I was in my basement playing the music, then I go upstairs to grab a drink, come back down and its still playing. A while later, go upstairs, let the dog out and then back in and come back down to uninterrupted music. Mu house isn't large by any means, but its not exactly small either. What I'm trying to say is, this thing is pretty dope especially for the price. Would recommend.
Extremely frustrating waste of money. Frustrating to find a power source to charge the unit, frustrating watching the unit turn off while charging and not continue to build a charge, and then frustrating to see the unit shut off before it can play even 1 complete song. Inconsistent, frustrating unit. Not worth the hassle.
I teach classes and when I show YouTube videos I need to boost the sound coming out of my laptop so that everyone can hear. The sound that comes out of this speaker is very good for it's size and price. And since I always have a lot of stuff to carry, I particularly appreciate how light it is.
I purchased this as a gift. I was very impressed with the sound quality for such a small speaker. If your looking for big bass this speaker isn't for you, but it's really not made for that. But if you want good sound from a pocket sized package this is the one.
Little engine that could...once I figured out how to pair it on my phone (had to go into settings & pair it) my phone found the signal really easy & fast but guess it was trying to pair to to much stuff at 1 time seeing I had echo show there also anyways once I did get it paid it was clear & louder than I expected from a tiny speaker I dont know anything about the battery span on this lil guy for it's a gift to my sons elementary childhood friend to bring with him to the courts it's worth what I paid I think hot it on Amazon deal of the day so I saved $$
I have purchased a few speakers to listen in the office and this has to be THE BEST little power house speaker... that I went an purchased a second unit ...
I only charge it because I dont want it to die.  It has never died.  Great sound from a little speaker.  Havent checked the water proof thing and dont have any intention.  Live on the ocean so its in salty moist air and still doing great
This is the worst Bluetooth speaker Ive ever had. I just opened it and charged it and Ive tried playing a variety of different genres and they all sound absolutely horrible. The sound is terrible, music sounds better coming from my phone than this speaker. I threw away the box after opening it (huge mistake) and doubt I can get my money back. DO NOT BUY THIS SPEAKER.
I love my JBLGo2! The sound quality is superb for the price -- I'd hazard a guess that it's pretty unbeatable at this price point, but I haven't purchased other options and run comparisons. The design is aesthetic -- I'm proud to show off my bright blue cube, and battery life has not been a problem, at all! I think I've only charged this once in two months. I just love it. No latency, no bass distortion, clear sound quality. At one point I was listening to children's songs with my niece and it sounded like singing kids were all sitting in my room. Crazy. It's easy to pair with any device (just enable bluetooth and connect), though I find the little noise that plays when the device connects/disconnects annoying.
Died after sixty days. Prior to its untimely death, worked wonderfully. Now, when you turn it on, it works for a minute then shuts off. Turning it back on, results in an immediately shut down. Assuming that there is a faulty transistor or a bad solder, there is no way to investigate, much less repair.  Another Made in China product in the trash. Update 4/10/21. Harmon has offered to replace the speaker, since it was beyond the 30 day Amazon time limit.  if they can duplicate my experience, they will send me a new unit. Harmon suggested it might be a faulty battery. I returned it to them via UPS Ground, at their expense. Hopefully, I will have a new speaker, in a few weeks.
I have a cheap Drips speaker that I bought on sale 4 uears ago for $10 at a highway service plaza. Although the Drips is not as loud as this speaker, it has better bass.  Thats really the only wireless speaker I have to compare it to. The sound quality is not superior and it could use a little more clarity at high volume. If you dont care about the bass, you will probably be very satisfied at this price point. The speaker is small enough to carry with you for traveling, which is great. The Drips battery only lasts about 2 hours, but this one seems to last much longer, although I cant say with any certainty how long. I would buy this again.
Easy to maintain a conversation with 3 people sharing the same microphone. Everyone could be understood and everyone could hear the other end --everyone took note to maybe get one. Plays music clearly and as expected for a speaker so small (little base). Plays speaking podcasts or talk radio perfectly, more clear than any of my other speakers. Easily transported and fits in most any container (I put it in a sandwich bag in my lunch box to protect it).
This bluetooth speaker was my favorite gift this past Christmas.  It's effortless to set up and the sound quality is great.  I didn't know when I got it that I could use it for phone conversations, that's an added bonus.  It has good range too.  I like it so much that I got one for my girlfriend, and she loves it too.  Excellent speaker!
Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Amazing little speaker, with great quality! I have only had it for about a week and Im in love with how easy it is to carry with me. I actually bought a silicone case to go with it for a bit of protection against cracks or scratches. Works well together!
I bought this speaker to use in the shower and when I go outside. It works great for what I want to use it for. I put this baby right in the shower Im so glad youre with me and theres no problems. It pairs fast without any problems and has a long battery. I can leave my phone in one room and go to another room with the speaker and it still sounds great and its nice and loud. It works great for having some background music on during the day. Its also stylish and cute and you can get covers for it to protect it.
When it's working, it sounds good. The problem is, it constantly disconnects itself so you'll have to keep manually connecting. It was doing this when it was just a few days old; I was just too busy at the time to worry about returning it. I think a few other people mentioned the same Bluetooth connectivity issue. I see it's now $10 more at $39/each. I suggest getting a better speaker (that does not require you to constantly re-connect it).
I'm switching from Altec Lansing, I've been having problems with that speaker for some time. This JBL speaker is so clear! And the sheer volume that I can get from this little speaker is amazing! It's not bass heavy as I feared. Also acoustic music sounds very natural and undistorted. I have not tried the bluetooth but I'm sure it works well and the same cab be said for the waterproofing. This is a very good speaker and will buy more in the future!
I bought a couple of these little shower radios last year on Black Friday. After a year of regular shower use (and for long walks) I was so impressed I bought a bunch for family and professional gifts. Highly recommend the spud is good, surprising for such a small radio. Bluetooth connection flawless.
Loved everything about this speaker EXCEPT that theres no way to find out how much battery life it has left. Wont show on your phone when its connected to Bluetooth. Kinda unexpected for a well known brand like JBL. Even obscure brands will usually show battery life on Bluetooth connections. Returned bc of this. The sound is really nice.
Great little speaker with a great bass, worth the money for sure, JBL is a great company the sound got 4 stars because its not as loud as the flip 3 which you cant be to harsh because its a lot smaller and cheaper but its great for the house compact to bring to the beach or games Im very happy and I love the orange color. Only complaint I do have is that the charger it comes with is literally 3 inches long extremely short but no biggie I had another charger. Deff worth the money best speaker in its price range for sure
I've had this for about 4 months. I'll turn it on and it will sound great for a little while but then the sound goes out. Almost like the Bluetooth has a bad connection. I'll turn it off and on, connect it and same thing. Works for a tiny bit. Figures this happens less than a month after the return window closes.
For such a small speaker, it packs a good punch! It'll never have the bass a subwoofer has, but it does a good job of faking it. Mid-range and high end are all crystal clear. JBL makes great products. Unlike some other manufacturers [*cough, Bose] who charge you an arm and a leg for mediocre sound. I bought this on a lark and I'll probably use it more than I thought I would. Music while I do dishes? Cool!  :)
I bought this pocket speaker as a Christmas gift for my husband...Even though its small, JBL doesn't disappoint!! The sound quality is great and the battery life is as well, much better than personally expected.  Would recommend for any music lover that is also an avid outdoor enthusiast.. great for listening to your favorite Spotify on the go anywhere!!
This speaker works great, and has very good sound for a small speaker. It's great to use in the car too. I cannot use it to get to sleep, however, because when it auto shuts off it plays a sound that wakes me up. If they can turn off the auto off tone, I would give it 5 stars.
Typical JBL sound quality (EXCELLENT), but overall life was very poor! Quit working altogether 2 months after the 1 yr warranty expired! Have other products from JBL, all are great performers. Just don't buy this one!?!
For $30 and fitting in the palm of your hand, don't think you can beat the sound quality. It's too loud to use at work unfortunately (even on lowest volume) so it does have some power. UPDATE: The device has completely stopped working about 6 months after I bought it. Total piece of junk.
Three stars overall because I find it very annoying that it shuts down in a short amount of time during inactivity. If I pause a video for just a few minutes it drops off. I don't really use the battery only feature by itself, I keep it plug in on the charge port on my desk. Good sound, makes watching youtube videos easier for this old man.
Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Nice construction JBL quality. Sound quality is good it's not tinny or hollow. Highs and mids are crisp and clear bass is thumpy. No droning or distortion. Easy to connect and no drops. Phone calls are good. Person on the other end heard me clearly. Battery life is good. Overall volume level is good although some may want it to be louder. For this size it's good i can hear it while I'm showering. Its waterproof so maybe next time I'll have it in the shower with me instead of on the counter. If you want louder volume I suggest getting a bigger speaker. This is good for a room or close quarters. There is zero latency no lip sync issues which is a huge plus.  The one thing I don't like is you can't connect this to more or other JBL speakers. Connect plus is missing. Maybe there will be a firmware update.  Battery life could be a little longer but it's ok. I've heard other speakers in this size and price range and can't think of any that's better several that may be just as good but not better in terms of sound quality and use as a speaker phone. Picked it up on sale $29. At that price if it had connect plus I would buy a handful of these.  UPDATE: Bought another one. Blue this time. I like the way it feels. Like soft velvet metal if that makes sense. I'm tellin ya if this had multi pairing whether they want to call it connect connect plus or party mode I would have a handful of these.  Firmware update JBL! Kinda wonder if they sent me a renewed version though. The tape was different.  Nah they wouldn't do that. Would they? 
***UPDATE 6-18-2020*** I have used this speaker in every shower for about 6 months now. The sound is still great and there is no water damage. The battery lasts a long time. *** I bought this speaker for one reason, I wanted a decent speaker for my shower that wasnt overpriced. My shower time is my relax time, but the wife and kids complained about my noise. I ordered this speaker, stuck it in the shower rack and the sound was perfect. It did not carry through rooms to disrupt my family. She saiid she couldnt hear it. This is exactly what I needed.
I got this to replace my $200 Bose speaker that gave out on me after only 2 years. While this doesn't have the sound that the Bose did (it's a little tin-ish), it's REALLY good sound. Surprisingly good for the size and price of the speaker. The speaker is the SIZE OF MY PALM. It will easily fit in a coat pocket or purse.
UPDATE:  I returned this item a month ago and I was never refunded my money. I have the receipt from UPS from when I shipped it, I have contacted customer service, I know for a fact they received the return, yet they have kept my money. This is a scam. I was so hopeful about this little speaker, but was ultimately disappointed. I will be returning it. The sound is tinny. It cant support the little bit of bass, vibrates all over the place, distorting the sound. This is literally no different than the $10 waterproof blue tooth speaker I already have. If you want this to listen to music in the shower with you, the sound would be ok. But theres no way to hang it so Its really not much louder than my iPhone. This would be a good gift for a pre teen I guess- IF they drop the price by about 60%. Just go to the dollar store, honestly. I wanted this speaker to be able to listen to music in my car since my car stereo died. But you cant hear it with the window down at all. Its pretty much useless to me. I dont recommend this. Ill be saving up for the more expensive, larger model of this, which I already know to be of better quality.
This little box is full of vibe.  While not the most powerful, the quality of sound is good and will be a perfect addition to the patio, on the golf cart, at the beach, or in the boat.  It is so small that it would fit in a pocket or purse.  It paired to my Samsung Note 9 easy.  Not sure of the water resistance because I have not had that experience yet and hope not to.  I ordered the orange and love its vibrant color.
It simply stopped working, it was a christmas present so I started using it basically in January and today (March) it died... When I contacted customer service they didn't do anything about it, they told me the returning period ended already... please explain how am I supposed to return it in that short time,  this speaker is supposed to last long and the minimum I expected was a year or something, it's a JBL product we're talking bout, not a generic brand. Too bad they don't really care about us customers. If you can buy it anywhere else, do it. Best Buy has a way better and friendly customer service, you can buy it online there too.
Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Just opened my JBL2GO and love it so far. I'm not stranger to bluetooth speakers. I've bought same price range water proof speakers and they always only last a few months. The quality of this little speaker is nice. It's got some weight to it. You just expect better quality from a name brand like JBL. I got this to use at work since there's a lot of background noise and hard to hear videos. But also just around the house leisure. The sound quality is good. For it's size and price you're getting a great deal. It's compact and sounds great.
Great volume and sound quality. Great color, even nicer than the picture. Waterproof quality confirmed. Incredible battery life, in my case lasted more than 5 hours. Bluetooth range is very wide, great. Materials are great and Canada Federation certified that none of the materials are dangerous for health. I just cannot believe i got such great product for what I paid. My friends loved it too, said they will buy them selves one for each. THANK YOU for selling such a great product !!!
These little speakers are buggy as hell. If you order one, be sure to use it a lot in the first few weeks to ensure it's working properly while you're still within the warranty period. I've ordered two. The first one wouldn't charge at all and the second one only held a charge for an hour or so.
I have a large speaker that we typically take to the pool that's on wheels and gets LOUD, but it can be a hassle when you want to bring music to enjoy for a quick trip or we go somewhere without lugging something huge around.  This speaker is perfect, small and light enough to be thrown in a backpack or tote, battery life for hours, and waterproof so I can bring it right to the pool's edge.  It's not as loud as some other larger speakers of course, but it's portability more than makes up for that.  Audio remains largely undistorted unless you try to really push it to max volume and play music with heavy bass, but after several weeks of use it still sounds as good as the day I got it.
The sound is alittle muffled but good enough for what I wanted it for (just while cleaning or getting dressed). Love the color! It did come with a pink charging cord which is odd but whatever.
Love this little speaker. Easy to use and convenient.
Like all speakers its the users ear that differentiates the sound quality. Overall this little speaker performs well, I use it in the bathroom and although only playing for say 15 minutes a day the battery is long lasting.
Sounds nice, but a 4 hour battery life is a joke. There are other companies that make stuff with the same sound quality that last a half day or more on one charge. This guy cant even keep up with my portable speaker from 6 years ago and its less than prime battery.
Used this for this first time today at the beach and we all loved it. Plenty loud and super cute and portable. Hopefully it lasts in the long run:). But highly recommend and fast shipping.
I love this JBL portable speaker. I use this everywhere on my house and outdoors. Its Perfect for the kitchen perfect for the shower and perfect for sunny beach days. Its lite weight and the battery can last for days! I definitely recommend this JBL Product!
Very nice blue tooth speaker - typical JBL sound.. which is great.  Water proof - you can let it float in a pool or submerge.. Not sure how far down you could submerge it - but for typical use around water its solid.
Wow. This tiny speaker can really pump out great-sounding music.  It fills the entire 15x15 foot room that I'm in.  Folks keep asking me where I purchased it.  I am recommending it to everyone who needs a lightweight decent sounding portable speaker.
Sounds good. Loud for such a small speaker. Have had it for a while now and have no problems. Wish it could link up with another speaker, but as far as everything else goes I would buy it again.
This is a decent compact little speaker although mine sounds a little muffled at times. Battery life lasts about 4 hours but I wish it was double that.
This little speaker has a powerful punch of sound. JBL has done it again competing against others for the price. This was a gift for my 25 years old son and HE LOVES IT!
UPDATE: I've had this now for 5 months.  Purchased it for $29 and I thought that price was high.  Now I see it's $39.95 and I WOULDN'T BUY THIS AGAIN.  It has great sound for it's size, but although it shows up on bluetooth and shows that it's paired on 3 different computers (both Apple and pc), it NEVER produces sound that way.  We still have to cart around a phone jack when using this, so don't buy it if you want guaranteed blue tooth.  Very disappointing. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This is compact and I like how it looks, but I had several key problems with it.  Problem #1 -- I couldn't get it to turn on!  Seriously!  After many minutes of fussing with it, I had to read on-line reviews before I figured out that you have to hold down the "on" button for 30+ seconds, like it was being re-booted.  IMO, very strange for a new product. THEN....problem #2 -- I purchased it to be the speaker for my desktop computer, which has bluetooth.  I was easily able to get it to pair, and although it showed up on my computer as paired - THE SPEAKER REFUSED TO PUT OUT SOUND unless it was plugged into the computer with an audio jack.  I was never able to figure out why and by that time I was kind of pissed off at the damn thing.  Although it worked for my phone, it has never worked with my computer.  I contacted the seller, and they said to "read the manual", THEN... problem #3 --- the "manual" consisted of several diagrams and minor information about warranty in 15 different languages.  Lots of paper, but basically, NO MANUAL. I've been purchasing many items on-line, but I'm getting tired of products made in China not working.  I probably won't return this, but I won't buy this brand again.  Hope this review helps someone.
For the price, this is a decent little speaker. It has better bass quality than my old can speaker, but does not have the clarity I might have expected. That said, this is inexpensive and it is small - so you can't really expect it to sound like an in-room symphony. The battery life is great. I use this to stream music while I'm cleaning, and doing other random things around the house, and for that, it perfectly fine. Don't forget you can adjust volume on the top of the speaker and/or through your device, so if it doesn't seem loud enough one, the other, or both may need to be adjusted.
Your browser does not support HTML5 video. This is by far the best compact portable Bluetooth speaker. Waterproof, relatively durable. My 3 kids (two 14yo, one 8yo) all have one of these. I highly suggest buying a case for speaker, For added protection against scratches/nicks. Speaker is stupid easy to connect with any device. Sound quality is better than I expected, volume was surprisingly loud for how small speaker is. JBL compared to Bose or Beats has the same great qualities/products for a fraction of price. Side note- Charger port plug area Will NOT be waterproof if not kept closed.
Solution to a Looooong seeking problem.  This JBL GO2 is indeed Impressive.  This is my Forth (4th) attempt to resolve the on going "Sound Quality & Volume" problem associated with regards to virtually ANY laptop.  I currently own a Bose SoundLink II speaker system that I utilize with "One" of my laptops that I do not transport and stays on my desk.  I have owned the Bose system for about 15 years and although it is somewhat "Large", it indeed is a VERY IMPRESSIVE, Reliable and Quality portable speaker system... but sadly, they are no longer available except "Used"... Sooooo for awhile now I've tried Three (3) other "Laptop) external speaker systems, yet getting poor quality results both in audio quality and especially "Volume".  Until TODAY when I received my new JBL GO2 speaker system. Admittedly, I was "Torn" between the JBL GO2 and the JBL Charge 3 (because it was a "Stereo" system), but for the price difference I thought I would try the JBL GO2 first and I am SO glad that I did.  First, in "Champaign" it is incredibly attractive.  And although relatively "Small", the sound "Quality" AND "Volume" are Outstanding.  All at an Incredible Low Price of only $39.00!  THAT is an incredible deal, bargain and Value.  Is it as "GREAT" as my "Bose SoundLink II"... No, BUT it is STILL an incredibly Outstanding portable speaker system at a fraction of the cost of many "Other" portable speaker systems out there... and I wouldn't Hesitate to purchase it again or recommend the JBL GO2 to anyone. If you're looking to "Up" your laptops inadequate sound quality and volume... do yourself a favor and Try the JBL GO2, I believe you'll be happy you did... and if not then return it and go for the JBL Charge 3 or the 4... One of them has GOT to satisfy you, or you're just not capable of BEING satisfied. Happy Listening!
This little box is great, so compact its hard to believe how much sound comes out. I carry it all around the house where ever I am working, its also powerful enough that I can leave it in one room and work in another and have no problem enjoying the music, great for house parties (adults, teenagers might want something much loader) where you want music but want to be able to carry on a conversation as well. I leave it on in my computer room and the sound travels very well down the hall into my living room. great buy.
So far so good.  Looks exactly like it did in the picture and it sounds great!  I also like how its waterproof so it can be used in the shower.  One thing to note, the charging cable does not come with the wall mount, just a cable.  Also, the cable is only 12.  All in all, Im completely satisfied with this purchase and would buy again.
Pros: -I can throw it in my bag and it takes up nearly no room and doesnt weigh nearly anything -Great volume -Decent battery life I find myself reaching for this more often than my Charge 3 Cons -Of course, barely any bass -No way to see how much battery is left Summary: In the past Ive had absolute nightmares with JBL customer service (paying for a new speaker and them sending it to someone else and then fighting about sending it to me) so the only reason I purchased this was the price. It definitely does the job! I will enjoy the product and hopefully never have to interact with their customer service
I purchased this because it was listed as an "Amazon Choice" for portable speakers that work well with Amazon Dot.  I have been disappointed with its performance.  Sometimes it just shuts off even when it is in use.  It loses power quickly and often won't connect via bluetooth.
I haven't tried to see the water resistance factor.  The sound quality is amazing.  I like that there are + -' volume controls on it.  So I can increase or decrease the volume from my "device" AND the JBL.  I also like that it has an automatic turn off feature, if I forget to turn it off.  The battery charger is good.  Although it doesn't come with a wall or electric outlet adapter.  I had a couple extra laying around.  So no problem.  You may want to consider a longer battery charger USB cable.  Which will give you more flexibility on where you listen, when on battery.  It does carry a five hour charge.  A few days ago I was on a phone call on 'Bluetooth' with it and took it outside to go to the mail box, while on the phone.  I left my cell in my house and walked about 100 feet outside to my mailbox and the phone quality stayed the same.  I highly recommend this item.  My girlfriend has one she paid $200 for and the sound isn't as good as this $30 product.
Very compact and easy to pack. Speaker battery last for over 4 hours. Connects quickly to all of my apple devices via blue tooth.
Great size, I use it mainly on my scooter but I  also take it to the park. It sounds great and the battery lasts a long time, I would say almost 5-6 hours straight with loud music.
Excellent sound for such a small speaker with the caveat that it is hard to plug in due to recessed port so with my osteoarthritis, it is DIFFICULT to plug in, but I guess that's the price for being waterproof.
Purchased this so that my 92 year old mom could hear the phone conversations. Works great and small enough to take in my purse. Just wish charging cord was longer.
Great little speaker! I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sound coming out of this little guy! I mostly use it when out side doing yard chores, connecting to my favorite music through my phone.
Speaker lasted two recharges. After second one speaker lasted maybe 10 minutes per full charge. Needless to say it's now in the garbage
Got this for my husband. He has a motorcycle so he keeps this speaker in his small compartment. Sound quality is great and as long as you charge it battery life is good.
Bought this for secret Santa for a family exchange and my brother in law loved it. Its small and easy to carry. We did test the sound quality before gifting it just in case and it sounded great. Hes had no complaints. I cant say anything about better life because I dont personally use it to know.
Needed a speaker for 2002 Jeep. I bought a cheap speaker and sound quality was terrible!! My son talked me into this and to my surprise the sound quality is amazing for something so small! Definitely worth the money!
This is my second Go2. The first one my wife took control and I wanted to have another to bring around the backyard, work, or wherever... The sound quality is pretty impressive for such a small device, connectivity was never an issue and the 5-hour battery life is more than enough for most applications. It is quite inexpensive.
these JBL GO2 speakers are ok but they CAN NOT link or pair together , because the don't support the JBL CONNECT feature . I returned it .
As described.. connects really easy but the Grey with grey buttons makes me weak..?.. JBL should have done Button contrast maybe darker grey so it doesn't blend with the primary color.. my opinion.. but still an excellent product and its water proof..
It's hard to believe what great sound JBL can pump out of their small speakers. This one is very small and yet sounds full and loud. Quite impressive for such a small speaker! This works great as a small portable speaker when you want to play something to a classroom from your iPhone. Can't brag enough on this very little speaker!
The sound quality is good for this price, but the battery is the one that turns this product to 1 star. The speaker works well for about 2 weeks... then suddenly the battery will dead after 2 minutes of playing no matter how long you charged the speaker.... I think I might just unlucky and got a defective product.
I had a JBL speaker before this one and it lasted 5+ years and was amazing sound quality and my favorite. Bought this one when that one died and it stopped charging after 5 mos. (outside the return timeline!). Luckily Amazon is standing by their customer on this one but not happy with JBL quality in this product overall.
Nice construction JBL quality. Sound quality is good it's not tinny or hollow. Highs and mids are crisp and clear bass is thumpy. No droning or distortion. Easy to connect and no drops. Phone calls are good, which is the main reason I bought this. Person on the other end heard me clearly. Battery life is good. Overall volume level is good although some may want it to be louder. For this size it's good i can hear it while I'm showering. Its waterproof so maybe next time I'll have it in the shower with me instead of on the counter. If you want louder volume I suggest getting a bigger speaker. This is good for a room or close quarters.
So far, this thing is great. I only bought it for the shower and so I can bring it to work which it works fantastically in both areas. The sound is good, better than my cell phone speakers which is really all I was trying to beat. It's won't blow you away and there are better BT speakers out there but for the price (I paid 20 bucks) and for the size of it you can't beat this. Would definitely recommend for anyone just looking to get a small form, portable BT speaker.
I got this to help with the audio for a laptop my work gave me to use. The laptop is new, but the audio is really weak and I couldn't hear well on Zoom calls. I've had other bluetooth speakers but NONE are even close to the quality of this JBL. I got it on Prime Day, but for the quality, it's a great deal at regular price. The sound is outstanding. I'm so happy with the sound for my music, too. Puts the other more expensive bluetooth speaker I've had to shame. I am not a sound expert or snob, but I really like this.
I ordered this for my 70-year-old mother who is now forced to use zoom because of covid-19 and public safety. But she was having a hard time hearing what other people were saying through her tablet speakers. I bought this and the sound quality is pretty good. Personally I wish it were a little bit louder, but I think that has to do with the other people that are speaking on zoom and their devices not having good sound quality.
This speaker sounds much larger than it is. It doesn't have as much bass as some of my similarly-sized Bluetooth speakers, but it makes up for this with its great tonal balance and separation. In my listening space, I step back about 6 feet  from this little speaker and it sounds wide. It's also much lighter than my other speakers, so I end up throwing this in my backpack more often than the other ones. My comparison speakers are the Mira F10 (which is also awesome) and the original canz.
What a great little speaker! Not only is the sound excellent, but I can throw it in my purse and take it with me wherever! Because my auxiliary port is broken in my car and I don't have bluetooth in my car, I take this little speaker with me so that I can listen to my podcasts while I'm driving. I've had it for over a year now and still works great!
I purchased this speaker, because of the price and because it is water resistant.  I take it to the pool and use it when I shower.  This speaker is very loud, louder than my Alexa at full volume.  It is a crisp speaker and I would purchase one again.  Battery life is ok, but I put mine on the charger every time i'm done using it, this is why I have given 4 stars instead of 5.
I have used this speaker for over a year now and I absolutely love it! Great product for the price. The bass and sound quality are extremely clear for the size and the water resistance is great! I use it mainly in the shower and it has withstood even getting small drops of water in it with placement. Have not submerged it in water so cant speak on that. Battery life is long lasting as well!
5 hour battery life is conservative. It's been on 3-4 car repair sessions of that duration, with charging between sessions, and its it's a champ. Now I'm not trying to blow the world away, just listening quietly to music while I work. But it's great, big sound for a pocket size speaker. Had it playing Christmas music in the corner and my dad didn't even know where the speaker was. Very pleased.
Speaker is a bit smaller then i thought but thats fine. I use it while i work in the garage. I have an average size 2 car garage and it is just loud enough to fill the garage with sound. The highs are crisp, mids are ok bass is a bit lacking but expected with this size speaker. Overall im satisfied.
This little guy packs a punch! It's smaller than I anticipated, but that doesn't take away from the sound. Had I looked at the item description, I'm sure I would've known what to expect. This is my go to shower speaker and jam session speaker. I don't submerge it in water, just have it chilling on a rack while I shower. It's never given me any problems, and the battery life is pretty damn good.
I had a larger JBL speaker with woofers and this speaker is actually a great replacement. I got during Cyber Week deals and am so glad I brought it. The battery life is great, I charge it 2x a months and listen to it for like 5 hrs at a time. It as loud as a larger lower quality brand speaker and better. I love the skip button feature. It's great for travel as well. Definitely recommend.
This product is absolutely awesome!! I have it located in my bathroom. It plays nice and loud and it can go for a long period of time with out having to be recharged!!
Bought this to put on the deck while swimming.  It is a great item and easy to use and hook up to blue tooth.  But the sound isn't loud enough.  It's fine if you're swimming with just a few people but once you add a few more people, the sound is not strong enough to hear.  Great for indoors or smaller places but not the best choice for outdoor parties
My hubby likes to use this while chilling out next to the fire pit. Great for news, sports, and music. I can also use it as an intercom to the back yard by calling him. Because it is connected to his phone, he can answer anytime. He also likes the clip so that he can move around and still have it close by.
Our grandson asked for this for his birthday. I was skeptical of how it would sound. But I was pleasantly surprised. The bass was very good and the sound quality was excellent. He was very happy with it, and that's what's important. I would recommend.
This speaker worked great. Was easy to charge.  Maybe used it a total of 15 times for an hour to an hour and half at a time.  So here it is May and it doesn't work.  Tried to charge it thinking that was the problem. BUT NO will no charge, turn on, Doesn't' work.  Not happy about it.  Should have lasted  longer. I was very careful with the speaker and now dissapointed.
I like this little speaker so far! I bought it to replace a Scoche BoomBottle that I have had for nearly 6 years that finally leaked. Sound quality is definitely on par with other brands of this price point. It does not have as much bass as my SoundLink mini, but I would not expect it to being about the size of an Altoids tin! I will update my review if I come across any issues, but I think it is a great value this far.
I was a little worried ordering this little guy as I have not had great experiences with portable speakers in this price range.  I have to say this speaker is great.  Great sound quality and volume levels to fill a good size space. I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase. My only complaint if it could be considered a complaint, is the charging cable is way too short and while I love the power off battery saver feature, it does mean ya gotta get off your lazy bum and turn it on if you stop using it for any length of time.
it's cheap and a decent enough speaker, sound quality is alright, there's absolutely no bass to speak of! other reviews that mention the speaker is thumping are puzzling? I don't know if I got a defective unit? the speaker connects well enough while my phone is about 7 feet away.
This works great for my needs which is primarily for audio books, podcasts and Zoom calls.  I haven't tried listening to music with it as I have several other options for that.  It has good clear sound with plenty of volume (I can hear it fine when I'm in the shower and it's outside), yet small enough to fit in my pocket.  It's a great replacement of an older speaker from another manufacturer that served me well for several years.  This new one is an upgrade with a power indicator light and auto shutoff which are very useful features.
I call this speaker my little friend.  I carry it from room to room with me listening to music.  It is small but does a great job.  I have a blue speaker and a black speaker.  Each one works for about 5 hours on a charge.  JBL-GO2 works well and is easily paired with another bluetooth device.  I use it with my cell phone, my ipad, and my TV.  I recommend it.
The colors POP! The sound rocks! The speaker is a MUST BUY perfect for throwing in ur backpack & hitting the beach, the pool, the air! Buy it!
This was purchased for a small, 'brand name' portable option for going room-to-room when cleaning, working in the garage, etc. Very good sound for a speaker about the size of a pack of cigarettes--pairs very quickly to all of the devices I use it with around the house.  Unlike some small speakers, it doesn't 'peak out' or distort at max volume, it just stops getting louder.  I think some of the reviews going on and on about frequency response, etc., for tiny, inexpensive bluetooth speakers are a little silly, so I'll just say it sounds great for its intended purpose.  I've purchased two of these, use one at my kid's mom's house when I'm helping with stuff over there. Definitely would recommend.
I am glad to have an additional portable wireless speaker to use with certain devices. Yet, what else can I say but ACCEPTABLE? I wouldn't return it, since mini bluetooth speakers are usually disposable anyways. When automatically connecting to a device it will not work. I have to connect manually every single time. The cover for the micro usb port is too stiff, and difficult to unstrap.
Overall it has a great sound it loud and the bass is perfect. It easy but in a bag or anything or bring anywhere. It a perfect small speaker and I would recommend it to anyone JBL speaker is the perfect brand and the speaker works very well. If do not want a small speaker though not for you if want a small one or just want one, in general, I would recommend buying it and its price is good.
Awesome value for the money, I use it to play music when I'm working in the kitchen or singing in the shower. Super easy to set up and get connected, nice sound quality for the size. Can confirm it's water resistant. It's not a big monster that's going to blare music for a whole party but if you want a low-cost speaker that sounds better and plays louder than your phone, this is for you.
Bought for a Christmas present mid December, obviously they werent able to use it until after they got it on Christmas. As of 2/6, it stopped working. It has only been used in our home gym, never been dropped or even submerged in water. Unfortunately the return window closed on 1/30, so Im a week too late to return it unfortunately. Smh.
This is a powerful little speaker. When I saw the size I was skeptical of how it might sound, but I was not disappointed. Great sound quality. I like that it is not light, not flimsy. It does not take long to charge and battery life is great. I believe I used it for 8 hrs straight with my chromebook and I ended up having to charge my laptop while the speaker was still going strong. Love it!! Great price for the speaker!!  I would purchase again and I do recommend.
Perfect little bluetooth speaker! The sound clarity is JBL quality! Exactly what I'd hoped it would be. Thank You!
Volume didn't get as loud as expected. IF, you buy case -Clip can be turned and attached / used as carabiner. Doesn't come with any way to attach it to avoid losing it out on the water. Physical it is compact. Nice color. Says battery life of 5 hours but we didn't use it all day so I don't know but it took around an 1.5 hrs to fully charge
I bought this for my classroom for audio books and for my daughter to use to practice synchronized swimming. My students always comment how great the sound is and then want to know where I got the speaker. Also works great underwater for my daughter. Really good value!  I didnt expect such high quality for something so little and I inexpensive.
Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I bought this for my mom. Small Little box easy to carry. Genre of music that plays well would be dance hall, bubbeling, soft, alternative, rap. Nothing with too much bass. We use it in my mom small salon to play Zen music. Battery life seems to be ok. If you want play heavy metal or music with some bass I would suggest the JBL flip 4 (I have this one as well yes spend the extra money) husband heavy metal lover always reaches for that one. Hope that helps.
I used this product for the first time yesterday and was blown away at how small but LOUD and clear it sounded! I've been looking for a speaker that would be water resistant as well so I can listen while showering. I went through so many of those cheap ones that never work. I got this one on black Friday and let me tell you, JBL knows what they're doing. I highly recommend this product!! I can't say for longevity or battery life but will update on that later if anything changes . So far so great!!
I purchased this for my little one. Its very easy to setup with both of my phones, and signal distance is very good too. But, for the money we paid, DO NOT expect this tiny thing will deliver high quality sounds. Its just ok sound. I still give 5 stars because its tiny, portable, also with wire connection too. I tested when I took shower, yes, its waterproof.
The size is perfect for our kitchen! And I liked the color variety. This is the blue. I really wanted the champagne but that was out of stock for another month. But I think this is just right.
I never do Amazon reviews but this one is probably my best purchases of 2020. I originally had a google home but I was frustrated that it would disconnect a lot from my phone and I also found myself looking for portability. I heard good things about JBL and my friends had their products so I decided to get this. I'm obsessed. I love that it's small but powerful. Great for travel and keeps the connection with my phone. And I LOVE that it's waterproof for the shower. I can't recommend this product enough. If you're looking for a simple speaker with excellent sound and portability, this is it.
Very nice size. Sounds great. The price was excellent. A great little speaker to carry with you. Works well for phone calls. About the size of a sucrets box.
Unfortunately, this item will not recharge after the last time I used it. It was convenient and had good sound. Used only periodically, never dropped nor misused. I had it for less than a month and am returning. Not sure if I will give this another chance and have it go out again after warranty period as I've read with a few others. Wish I didn't have to return.
At first I was having trouble with it but then I downloaded the app and it worked sooo much better! But I love this speaker! Ive had it for over a year and my boyfriend loves it too lol.  Good for bathroom speaker, balcony, beach, or park.  And its so small that you can take it everywhere!
love the speaker and the color - easy to connect - not pleased with the usb wire - very short for a device that has a short battery life (3hrs) - and i cant even trade it out with an apple usb wire - just sad
I love this Bluetooth speaker. It has a pretty good sound for such a small item. It syncs well with my iPhone; however, I couldnt get it to connect to my husbands iPhone. The battery charges easily but you need to do it often. Great for the price.
Easy to use and great sound.  Kind of hard to see the icons on the top of it (at least on the black one).  The volume icons are raised though...those are a bit easier to find!  I recommend it though.
Bought this as a Christmas gift knowing nothing about how difficult it would be to use, but lucky for me their musical/techie son-in-law was able to hook up & put smiles on their faces.  Turned out to be a great gift.
I'm sure other people can live with it but it has this blinking white light that will not stop flashing and I guess I'm one of those people who gets really bugged by that. I sometimes listen to my music in the dark and have to cover it with a small cloth but I prefer not to have to do that. Otherwise, it does its job as a speaker.
Oh my god!  I couldnt believe the sound that came out of this little box!  I used to tear up the floors at the leading discos in Dallas, Texas in the 80s to songs by the Bee Gees K.C. And the Sunshine Band,!just to name a few.  I am 62 years young but now reside in a nursing facility having battled multiple sclerosis for 37 years.  With the pandemic, we are only allowed to go outside five times a day for only thirty minutes.  When I first got m JBL I went outside and cranked Her and my I phone up.  JBL was in my lap and for the first time in years I felt the base all the way down my legs!  Yes!  I said I finally had feeling in my legs!  I came in and immediately called my neurologist.  She is now recommending the JBL to all of her patients.  Ive even got movement in my upper body.  Now, other residents here have started going outside for the thirty minute shows and theyre starting to move too.  Glory be to God for giving the gift to those who came up with the JBL.  And for the price, most of the people here can still afford it!  Less than $40.  And to think I almost spent $149 because I thought it would be better.  NOT!  Thanks JBL and of course lets not forget Amazon!
Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I have purchased off brand mini speakers over the years to use in my office and they have been subpar.  They were good enough to enjoy music while I was there and that was about it.  I stumbled upon this name brand speaker while looking through Amazon deals the other day.  I read the reviews, watched a few Youtube reviews and decided to give it a shot.  I am blown away by the sound quality.  Make no mistake, this would not replace a large speaker by any means.  However, given the size, it went well above my expectations.  The ranges are clear and crisp and the bass hits really well.  It works perfect for a single room, like a bed room, office, etc.  For the price, size and quality, I dont think you can beat it.  The small size means its easier to move from room to room or take outside for outdoor activities.  The fact that its waterproof was a huge selling point as well.  While I dont intend on using it in the shower, its good to know it could be used without moisture damage.  This is my first JBL product and I would definitely purchase another JBL product based off of this one. Update 4/16: I purchased the Go 3 and there is a huge sound difference.  The sound quality in the Go 3 is so much better than the Go 2.  I believe normally they are the same price.  I would definitely go for the Go 3.  Even on sale with a $10 difference, I would still recommend the Go 3.
Okay. This guy is smaller than I expected and I was a little discouraged at first. Fortunately, after charging and turning it on, I was pleasantly surprised. The sound quality is great and the size is actually perfect - because it takes up minimal space. I love how quick and easy it connects and disconnects from Bluetooth. The battery life is average - nothing amazing but you just plug it in and juice it up.
I wanted a Bluetooth speaker that had great sound quality and was also waterproof and inexpensive. This check marked basically all of those boxes. My only real complaint is that even though it is a JBL some of the more expensive jbl's have way better sound quality. But keep in mind this is a very inexpensive speaker so for the price point you're getting a little more than what you paid for. I normally exclusively just buy Bose, but I didn't want to Shell out Bose quality speaker money for something that I'm going to use for 15 minutes when I take a shower. So I'm definitely happy with this product and would recommend this to anyone who wants a shower speaker, or a speaker you can take with you to a lake or something. Although when you're in open outdoors you may want to buy a speaker with a little more power since you're outdoors so the sound doesn't just get lost in the atmosphere or drowned out by whatever else is going on around you. Update 2/27/21: I accidentally left the speaker on a charger for 2 days until I got back to work to pick it up. When I got it home I brought it into the bathroom so I could jam out while I take a shower like I usually do and there was a red light on it and it would not disappear. The device wouldn't turn on, and it wouldn't turn off. It just steady had a red light going that wouldn't do anything. I thought the speaker had crapped out but after a quick Google search I realized that if/when that happens you need to hold down the power button until the light disappears. Forums online say it's about 30 seconds but I think it's closer to a minute... A lot of people were saying that doesn't work but I think they just weren't holding it down long enough. Got to hold that power button down almost until you think that it's not doing anything, and then hold it down for another 20 seconds lol Afterwards the speaker will work just like it always has. I just figured I would share that info with you guys just in case it ever comes up. But I stand by my previous statement. If you need a cheap Bluetooth wireless speaker that you can get wet in the shower, I don't really think you can get better than this one, and that is factoring in sound quality, price, and durability.
Im a fan of JBL. I have a larger JBL speaker that a held up for 7 years now and still going strong. Ive been changing up work spaces and needed something more portable, so I saw this on Amazon and figured Id give it a try. JBL did not disappoint! Its no Bose, Im not going to pretend it is, but its still awesome. Ive had this for about 8 months now I believe. This little thing packs a punch and can get loud. The sound quality is great. Ive used it at my desk, at home, in the yard, in the kitchen, hiking, camping. I havent tested its ability to resist water but I dont doubt it holds up. The open plug for charging and aux cable have a air tight cover that feels very secure. Appreciate the color variety you can choose from. The color holds up, so it keeps on looking cute! Love this, I would recommend to anyone looking for a small portable speaker, and Id def buy it again.
I got this as a gift for my 9 yr old niece and she loves it. She charged and connected it herself via Bluetooth to an iPod touch...kids are so tech savvy now. It is very small so it's perfect for a small girl like her to carry around. It also seems to be durable enough to withstand her handling. As small as it is, the sound is pretty darn good. She likes the stylish color too.
Sound quality is horrible on this thing. Yes it can get loud to hear, but don't mean you wanna keep hearing it.  Echo Dot has way better sound. JBL is known for quality sound and these are a huge let down. Tried using it on a call while in the pool, the microphone wasn't even connecting. 808audio Canz 2 have way better sound, bass, working microphone. Even Amazon's Anker brand is way better. So no Hey, Google/Alexa with this JBL, No Siri or a speaker for at least Zoom calls. No quality sound and if you listen to the people that say, "For the price of the speaker it sounds great!" Please stop making excuses for crap and admit you bought a crap item and were too lazy to send it back so you try to tell yourself and others it wasn't a waste of money. We put humans on the moon with computers that weren't even as advanced as an IPhone 5, I know for the price, other better speakers exist.  Love JBL. Know they can make great audio products, but also know this empty tin can of a speaker is not one of those great products. Also, the BT is wonky and maybe because it's usually over 110 for 3/4 the year here, the battery just doesn't last the stated time JBL why you do this to the people?
I have two negative things to say about this case only. 1: It should have the capability to sync and have two connected as stereo. WE WANT TWO AT THE SAME TIME!!! 2: There is no battery indicator on your settings for IPhone. OTHER THAN THIS.... BUY THIS FREAKING SPEAKER IS GREAT FOR EVERYTHING. movies, music, at work, at home, shower, the sound is amazing is not too loud that it distortions or too weak to not impress.
Omg - is it possible to fall in  love with a speaker that is no bigger than a bar of soap? Cause  I believe I have. Look, there is really no reason to go through all of the pros & cons as so many others have done before me.  In the end it is always a subjective call no matter what anyone says. The sound is more than perfect for enjoying music while Im reading or relaxing in my yard - clear and crisp with just the right amount of bass tones.  It more than gets the job done for such a tiny little thing that I can fit in my equally tiny little hand. Your decision, of course, but I think you ought to give it a shot.  If you arent expecting a concert hall to come out of the speaker, I do believe you will be extremely surprised & happy with the results.
This is a great speaker, however I cannot use when going to sleep. I tried to use it as a bedside speaker, but when it auto-shuts off, it makes a melodic sound that wakes me up. I wish it would auto shut off without making the sound. I would up my rating.
I love this speaker! I took it on a road trip with my older sister (big mistake) she loved it so much I had to give it to her! We played Motown in the hotel room and that was my undoing!! Now I need to purchase another for replacement! Sound quality is wonderful, good range for such a small speaker! The size is very compact. Nice unusual color selections, and its just so cute!!!  You wont regret getting this!
74 years old so I am a little late to Bluetooth but catching up.  A visiting friend (old person also) had one and I was amazed. Connected to new Samsung TV  which had a sound bar - put the JBL speaker on table between me and my wife and we were amazed at the sound quality and volume - better sound than the sound bar at 1/10 the cost.  Battery good for an evening if TV about 4 hours Would buy again.
not gonna lie, i was skeptical about buying this cause i was reading reviews about how these speakers don't slap, but bruhhhh, they slap. all i can compare the sound quality to is my marshall stockwell speakers, and these jbl's go just as hard. alright, maybe not as hard as my marshall's, but hard enough for us to waste even more water. i only bought this for our shower, so i can't compare it to any outdoor listening. but i'd definitely recommend you get one for your bathroom. (i'll come back and edit this if the speakers end up failing on me and pisses me off)
WOW! I absolutely LOVE this soundbox so much. Its so small but mighty. Great sound and the battery life is absolutely incredible!!! I had a jbl before and its lasted me for over 6 years but it was just too big. This one is so PERFECT FOR TRAVELING but also to use at home. Its definitely beneficial that its waterproof. I have never had any issues with it at all (had its for 2+ months). Super easy to use as well!
This JBL speaker is small but packs a mighty punch.  The sound quality is great, no distortion even at higher levels.  I love how portable it is!  Can't say enough good things about it.  Will be purchasing more from JBL in the future.  If you're considering buying it, just do it already!
This was a gift for my 12 yr old daughter. Its perfect size for her to tote every where with her and her friends! And it has amazing  sound for being so small! I would definitely buy this again! Its great for the beach or camping or chillin at the park!
I got into gardening during quarantine, and My phone wasnt loud enough to carry through my yard (its a big yard). This speaker is awesome! Super portable, and loud enough to hear throughout the yard, garage, shower! Wherever I go I take it. Its not going to give you concert audio I mean give it a break lol but it does what its supposed to do! And the battery life is amazing. Worth the money if you just want to listen to some music without blasting your roof off or hugging your neighbors.
It's an okay little speaker. Definitely packs a punch for the size, but not as much bass as I thought there would be. I haven't tested its water resistance so I can't comment on that feature, but if you can afford it I would recommend buying the next step up. You'll hear a difference in sound quality. All things considered, it's a good speaker for the money. JBL makes quality products.
This is a great little speaker.  I usually take it out by the pool and it has a great sound.  I keep it up off the ground but am not too worried about it getting wet as its supposed to be waterproof to a degree.  I also bought the case for it as I plan on taking it with me while traveling since its a nice compact little square.
I was in the market for something portable, durable build, decent battery, water proof and good sound for small get together a with freinds and when I'm up on a roof at work. Serves the purpose well and seems solid will update later after some use 
I was so excited to get this as my older rock block speaker has stopped working after years of use. This speaker has the same functions. Its a little smaller cute feels good in my hand and sounds great for its size. Perfect on the go! I used it twice and its not working anymore. I charged it. When I disconnected the cord the charging light stayed on and wont shut off. I cannot power on the speaker at all or use it. Will be returning or contacting the manufacturer. Bummer.
I have a Sony portable Bluetooth speaker. It is tiny and the sound is too! So reading the reviews, JBL came up frequentlyno matter what speaker product I was looking at. That's a big bold recommendation right there. So I ordered it and Im pleased with it. Good bass sound. Volume is goodwhich was my complaint against the Sony speaker. I cld turn it all the way to and it still wouldnt be loud enough. With this JBL, I have sufficient volume with room to turn it higherplenty of room left. Sound quality is very good. There is depth to speaking and musical voices. No feedback. Very, very compact; easily portable. Easily paired. But no directions come with it and no charger cord comes with it. Being an excellent product doesnt give JBL a pass on providing the ancillary equipment needed to operate their product. Is the product worth it? Only if you already  have the charger and know how to pair Bluetooth products. If you dont, its not worth having to buy one on general principle: a charger should come with the speaker along with the directions. Thats just SOP.
First I'm using this in a very specific manner so the issues I encountered might not be issues for most users. I bought this to use as a main computer speaker for my Mac Mini set up and a monitor that doesn't have built-in speakers. I didn't want to spend a lot on speakers nor did I want multiple/large pieces to clutter up my desktop. For the price and size, this thing is awesome! Sound quality is great and this little speaker can get LOUD. Bluetooth connection is quick and pretty reliable so no complaints so far. The only downside I've encountered so far is that the audio port can be very finicky I've had sound go low or completely cut out when the audio cable wasn't positioned *just* right. For reference, I'm using a Audioquest Tower cable. Again, I'm using it in a very specific manner so this might not be an issue for most people but just something to keep in mind if you want to plug it in rather than connecting through Bluetooth. It's also nice that is has a mic so it can act as a backup mic for use in Zoom calls, etc (have not gotten complaints about sound quality from co-workers yet).
I have purchased and returned two JBL GO2 Bluetooth speakers. The first one sounded good, had ok battery life, was waterproof enough to take into the shower, and died after about two weeks. I returned it and bought a replacement unit because I liked the sound and that it was small and waterproof. The replacement unit sounded harsher and died after two weeks. Needless to say, I will not be buying another GO2.
I just got this speaker yesterday and Im already conflicted. Some songs play perfectly clear but others, mostly rock songs and songs and songs that already have a lot of bass (as in what makes the speaker have a pulse not the instrument)  like the speaker has water damage which is strange for a WATERPROOF speaker that hasnt been exposed to water unless steam from 1 shower (it was 3 feet away from the shower) counts.
bought this to use on jobsites where a radio is allowed, and it has been working well for me. It isn't very big, so it also isn't very loud, but I knew that before purchasing. If you need a loud radio to hear over noisy construction jobsites, this isn't it, but if you want good sound quality for background music in an area with low/medium ambient noise, it works well. I was on a job site where I was working in a scissor lift by myself in an area with what I would consider to have "medium" ambient background construction noise. (Other trades in the area, but no excessive hammering, sawing, jackhammering, etc...) I'd usually have the radio at about half volume so I could hear and enjoy it, but still be able to hear what was going on around me. I would turn it off when not in the lift, breaks, lunch, etc. It would last a full 8hr. shift with no issues, never died on me. I would plug it in to a car charger overnight so it was ready for the next day. (My charger stays on with the vehicle off)
This is an impressive little speaker! We have tried several small, portable bluetooth speakers in the past and they all pale in comparison to this one. The sound is really great, size and shape is fantastic for portability, and so far it has been much more durable than others we have had. It also comes in a fun array of colors so each family member can choose their favorite and there are no more worries about getting them mixed up. Connects easily to every bluetooth enabled device we have paired it with and charges quickly. What more could you want? All in all, I have nothing but good things to say about this handy little speaker!
I was skeptical about this speaker at first, but as soon as tried it out, I was sold!  I love how compact it is and I love the color (cinnamon).  The sound is amazing for such a little speaker.  Its very clear,  the highs are great and the bass is surprisingly awesome!  For someone who grew up listening to $1600 Klipsch La Scala speakers, I was spoiled and nothing can compare to their sound, so to say that Im very particular about my speakers is an understatement.  I got it a great price on Prime Day and it would make a great gift.  Thanks JBL for making a great quality, compact, clean sounding speaker and thanks Amazon for offering it and putting it on sale for Prime Day!
This is a great little speaker. I wanted something small I could use to pair with my phone in my small office at work. Took it on vacation this week in case my kids forgot theirs (which they did LOL). When we were sitting outside on the deck I brought this outside. They all commented on what great sound it had. Im not an audiophile so I cant tell you about the bass, midrange etc. But to me it sounds great. Battery life is excellent as well. I never had to recharge while using this week so it was hours of use.
I picked this up to replace a cheaper Bluetooth speaker to use around my house, listing to music, watching videos and whatnot. I basically went by the price, which I think was well worth it. $30 for a solid feeling, and sounding speaker, that Im not trying to use as a huge sound system, is perfect. It feels good in in the hand, and the sounds come out clear, even at full volume, the bass is nicely balanced with the higher frequency sounds. Connection was really easy and quick. JBL Go2 Worked out perfect for my needs, highly recommend for those (like me) who just want better than the speakers on the phone.
We have a few JBL speakers we use for work. This one is small and has a great sound. I also purchased a case to carry and protect it. This little speaker has been a great addition to our mobile spa team. Its light, compact, durable and a good value.
Check the dimensions before purchasing, it is smaller than I anticipated. But it works well, sounds good, very compact, fits in the palm of your hand, I like the color and the features. I bought this one in replacement for an Oontz Angle speaker, I had two of those and they both just stopped working/charging after 2 years.  Hopefully this JBL will last longer.
Literally the second JBL speaker I bought and it stopped charging after less than a year ... chord and outlets are good ...Ive reset and Restarted it ....Ill charge it for hours and it will not charge at all
This little speaker has a loud speaker quality that will make you think you have a huge speaker.  I bought this for my son when he went away to college.  He takes it everywhere with him and is able to listen to his music while taking a shower without worry that the speaker will not work afterwards.
I really liked this little speaker but after 6 months, it wouldn't charge and when it did charge, it wouldn't connect to my phone's bluetooth. If it was charged fully and did connect to my phone's bluetooth, it would not play, saying it wasn't charged. I was really disappointed for the amount of money I spent on it
This is a small speaker and I did not expect a booming sound from it. It was just OK.  I bought a speaker from another manufacture that has a much better sound for a few dollars less. The size and dimensions of this speaker are nice and the color options are great, but some are on back order for 30+ days.
Amazing sound quality! Ive already had so many people say wow, thats loud for such a small speaker. I definitely recommend for the most bang for your buck.
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my fiance. He loves it!! Probably his favorite thing that i bought him. The sound quality is great, its plenty loud, and he loves the color.
Great sound for such a small item. Impressed with the quality of sound for what it is. Great piece for night stand, kitchen, etc. Just bring it with your phone anywhere. Put it a few inches from the wall on a dresser and sound is even better. Very happy with this product and have already bragged about it.
I love this little speaker it is so powerful the clarity of the sound is amazing. It stays charged for a long time if your using it on a daily you may have to charge it once a week.  Awesome buy
Really bummed. It was actually a good speaker. Bluetooth connect was easy. Volume was good. But not even a year and it's dead. I attached 2 brand new charging cords and nothing. The light is red. When I remove the cords and turn it on all I hear is kind of like a clicking sound but does not play anything whether from a bluetooth device or hooked in with the audio jack. I'm not going to buy another one simply because of the play time when not charging. I use this to listen to relaxing sounds while I sleep and it cuts off in about 4 to 5 hours. I can't fall back asleep without the sounds (just how I am) so I have to wait until it's charged. Nope, I just got a longer charge cord and left it plugged in. So, that's probably what killed it sooner. If it had a longer play time I would buy one again but I think I'm just going to find one with a longer play time while unplugged.
This is a good Bluetooth speaker and is, most definitely, an improvement over the speakers in my HP ZBook laptop and slightly better than the speakers in my Google Pixel 3a. I bought it after reading many reviews where people mentioned how loud it is. Before you buy it, remember that what's loud in a quiet dorm room, isn't loud in the park and is certainly not loud in a shop where a fan is blowing. At least it was cheap.
When I unpacked this little speaker, I thought I made a mistake ordering it It's so small! It's replacing a Bluetooth system that I 5x the size, but just got old. It blew me away right off the bat. No, it can't compete with the full size stereo I have at home, but I want it to play in my garage and my aircraft hangar. But the sound quality is incredible, and best yet, it fits comfortably in my cargo pants pocket. Extremely portable. Can't speak to the rechargable battery capacity yet, as it hasn't gone dead yet. And if it does, I'll just plug it in with the supplied USB cable. Definitely worth the 25 bucks!
UPDATE: after a short period, the speaker Bluetooth began to fail and, even worse, once I had tried to pair it, it interfered with the onboard speakers of my laptop and i had to restart the machine. Amazon tech support kindly issued a return label and processed a refund. Knocked down the rating. As I wrote originally, I love the size, and the sound (considering the size) is amazing. Fit and finish seem very good, and it paired and synced with both my iPad and my laptop like a dream. But the only manual, the so-called QuickStart, is teeny tiny little GRAY type! Who can read that??? And rolled so tight its hard to keep flat. I was able to find it online, full-size and black type, but its not terribly informative. I still dont know how long to keep the speaker plugged in to recharge the battery, or whether I can charge it through the computer. I havent used it enough to drain the battery yet, so cant report on battery life. I bought it because my otherwise-lovely new Lenovo Carbon 1x laptops speaker is just not loud enough for a comfortable Zoom meeting, let alone music.
Your browser does not support HTML5 video. When connected with aux, the speaker makes a strange hissing sound, with different pitches. It almost sounds like a fan. It's low and subtle, but noticeable. Particularly annoying between songs, or when on stand.
Shuts itself and disconnects from paired item very quickly when it is not receiving an active signal. I use this for my TV and PC sound player. When I mute sound or there just are no sound signals when pc is unused or tv is in speaker mode this speaker turns off. I tried using a wired connection instead of Bluetooth but this speaker still turns off about one minute after it has no sounds to play.  Also, the volume settings on this speaker do not include low volumes. Sound output can be too loud even at the lowest setting in some environments.
I bought one For my husband and once I heard it I had to get one for myself. When you get the speaker and see its diminutive size, you can't imagine it being all that loud. Just wait till you turn this little puppy on. Can easily rock half the house. Battery life is excellent. One note: turn the volume on the speaker all the way up and use your phone or Bluetooth device to control the volume (or vice versa). My husband complained his wasn't very loud, but his phone volume was on low and he was using the speaker to control the volume.
I bought this as a replacement for a bluetooth speaker I've had for 4 or 5 years. The sound quality of this speaker is the best I've seen for a portable speaker. Perfect for music. Controls are very simple and easy to use. The only thing I dislike is the loudness. It can be decently loud, in my large bedroom, it was loud enough to be heard throughout the room. I suppose I can't help but to compare to my last one, but I mostly use my speaker in the shower. This one just does not get that loud in there with the noise of the shower (note: tested waterproof by accidentally dropping it in the shower, and can confirm it is!). As I said, quality and design are great, I just wish the speaker was louder.
Good sound for a little speaker.  The battery life is pretty weak.  One of my biggest issue with it is that with such a poor battery, it doesnt even have a battery indicator to tell you how much charge is left.  Put that with the fact that there isnt any type of low battery, please charge warning and it can leave you without a speaker with out notice.
Anyone who rates this little speaker below 4 stars (unless they got a defective unit) is an idiot. Don't buy into it. I bought this for travel (I do it like 4 times a year for work.) This little thing blew me away. TSA doesn't sweat it in a checked bag and it sounds incredible. I listen mostly on my high end over ears at home (Galaxy Buds Plus on the go) and my good this sounds great. I have the latest echo in my living room for music when I have people over. This speaker is like 85% of the newest Alexa despite being barely bigger than an altoids tin. Bass response is immaculate given the size. Had 3 friends over at my hotel room the other day, we were all talking loudly and at 80% volume this thing was more than loud enough. I'm an audiophile in the most subtle of ways. I've had my original Audio Technica M50s for about 8 years. Recently replaced them with a high end set from Seinheiser. Because I broke the headband. You can order a reacsmsng to fix it with a little soldering experience, but I wasn't willing to wait a month for the part. My only gripe is sound quality deteriorates at max volume. But that happens with just about every speaker. I will bring this in my checked bag every single time going forward. Showering in a hotel room has never been so fun lmao
JBL is definitely not Bose with deep Rich bass acoustics, but it is a fairly loud speaker for the price. Purchased yellow; it's small and portable.  The only reason for 4 vs 5 stars include- lack of deeper bass and  annoying  start up and shutting down strange acoustic feedback.
My son originally bought this with his birthday money to use while playing street hockey, but it has FAR exceeded our expectations.  We know use it as a family for so much more.  Easy to connect the bluetooth and soooo easy to use!
Bought as a Christmas gift and they love it and use it all the time. It doesnt come with a charging box, which Im sure it says somewhere in the description.
I am rarely motivated to write a review. This little speaker warrants one though. This speaker was recommended by a family member who is a professional sound technician. I asked for something I could afford (retired) as I find myself listening to various news and entertainment selections on my iPhone. All. Day. Long. During this quarantine. Highly recommended.
I received faulty product at first (broken speaker), and had it replaced. The replacement lasted3 months of infrequent use and 1 month of daily usenow the sound is awful again. Id say thats very unreliable on a brands like JBL side!! Any warranty?..
Tiny, convenient with amazing clarity and entirely serviceable bass that I can't being better considering size...long battery life and waterproof... A great product and bargain.
I haven't tested the waterproof factor but I love the size of it. Easily fits in my pocket and nice for watching Netflix, music sounded decent and I haven't turned all the way up. It has a nice feel to the plastic and the metal grill is clean. Overall another good jbl product.
I use this to make noise while I backpack. Its small and im able to put it where ever on my pack. Loud enough to enjoy Metallica and keeps the predators at bay. Definitely worth the money. Sound isnt too bad, just make sure you bring a external battery charger, if you blast it, it will drain pretty quick.
easily portable ... it looks pretty .. sound quality is great ! It uses bluetooth to play the audio.  You have to charge it via your laptop.
This is a great product for the $! My kiddo has a cheap water proof speaker and its fine for her. After borrowing it a few too may times, I decided to get one for myself. I am very impressed with the upgrade of sound quality. It's most noticeable when I turn the volume up; really clear sound. I've already recommended it to several people.
We have three of these speakers, they are great for grab and go at the beach, in the golf cart or anywhere you are going and need a little music. Compact, light weight and quality of sound is perfect on the go. Battery lasts a long time, over 8 hours.
My husband loved his JBL and used it daily, but it has gone missing. This will be his favorite Christmas present,...guaranteed.
Easy connect. Sound quality is decent for size. Material is definitely better than expected. I'm satisfied overall.
This is the speaker I take with me while Im tubing down the river. Its a great cheap little speaker (I didnt want to take my $200 JBL lol), so I got this one. The only thing I wish was different is if there was a hook or carabiner on it so I could hook it to something.
Bought this for my son at college.  He loves it!  Now that he's home, I agree!  It's small enough to carry but still sounds good!  I'm imagining one on my desk at work in the not to distant future.
This item has good sound quality for its size.  Wish the battery life was longer, though.  Overall, connectivity is good, but sometimes I have to unpair and pair to get it to work.
This is a woderful little speaker with a lot of puch. Lots of bass if you like that...  I was so impressed at the sound.  ALso a good one is Clearly speakers... check those out to...
Perfect shower speaker! Ive had it for a couple months now and havent had to charge it. Very easy to connect via Bluetooth!
This blue tooth speaker is the easiest to use.  the quality is amazing and packs a powerful punch for it's size.  I loved it so munch I purchased several more and gave them as Christmas gifts.
Sounds fair for a small speaker. I have the JBL Charge 3 which is my preference for bassier music. This does fit in your pocket though.
For the price, waterproof capability, and the size, the sound quality is surprisingly good. Sure, can not get a heavy bass sound but that was expected prior to buying. However, like many other small portable speaker, placing with a solid wall behind it does provide better resonance and bass for the sound quality. I bought one to stay at vacation home and bought a second one for travel purposes because it is so compact.
Nice sound quality; but after only two months of use, you could no longer plug in the charging cord to charge it. Have never had one of these portable speakers wear out so fast.  Most last at least a year or two.
I love this speaker.  Small and easy to carry around.  I leave it on the deck and can hear good sound to the other side of the yard. If you like listening to your music outside...this is the speaker to get.
I purchased this speaker as a Christmas present, so I havent used it all that much. Just enough to make sure it works properly before giving away. For a tiny little speaker this thing puts out a lot of good quality sound. I am very impressed so far. The base hits pretty good too. I got it on sale during Black Friday for $20...steal! Not sure I would pay $30 as it is normally priced.
Had muffled/nasal sound. Was not loud enough to really be a supplemental speaker For my computer so I sent it back.
I havent tried it  near water, but for such a tiny box it makes a big sound. I was happy with the buy. I didnt expect much for the price and was surprised by the loudness. I marked it 4 because the base isnt quite there,  but is works great in my workshop.
I had this connected to my android phone while Zwifting.  Great sound, good volume, could easily hear it over my fans while I was pedaling away.  HOWEVER, after a few minutes the speaker would simply disconnect - I would have to power off/on again to get it working :(
Item arrived quickly! I have been using it daily and love that it is compact and volume is great. I can move around the house as I do chores or move around with no problem. Glad I purchased this, I will be buying one for my daughter too for her apartment.
Great little speaker, I use it on the job site almost daily. The only reason it didnt get 5 stars was that the charging/power cord sucks. Its almost as if its an after thought and they one in there just to say it had one. Its only about 6 long and its orange. If you plug it in, it will just dangle the speaker, it wont reach a counter or even the floor from a wall socket to charge. Other than that the speaker works very well.
Great little speaker. This blows larger, cheaper speakers out of the water when comparing sound quality and battery life. Perfect little speaker for use in shower, walking the dog, working outside, etc.
This works great and has good sound for its size. Take it anywhere!
I wanted a compact bluetooth speaker that wasn't too pricey. This fit the bill and the sound is very good. It comes in a variety of colors. I got the orange one and I'm very happy with my purchase.
I was expecting for this to be a little louder but it does its work. I know JBL has good speakers just wanted this to be a tiny bit louder. The charge on it does last long and the color green is so cute. I would buy it again
The sound was great listening to music but when I played white noise to sleep at night, the sound was scratchy. I returned it.
Awesome little speaker. Bought for my night crew in my meat department. They love it. Smaller prep room so the sound carries. Amazing sound from such a small speaker. Bluetooth is easy to connect to. Battery life is very good.
Havent had this very long, but was very impressed with the volume it was able to produce for being so small. Super easy start up. Literally turn it on, open your phone Bluetooth settings, then click on JBL. Instant music!
Tiny charge cord. Sound is ok but not nearly as good as other JBL. Battery life really could be longer so you could use it as a white noise machine. Also it will not pair with the app to use with multiple speakers.
I bought this for use in the shower however it sounds great so I take it to the beach and use it around the house and in my garage when I want music or a learning video as I'm working on a car project or whatever. I love this speaker. Great quality. And great Price!
My daughter listens to music while she showers and this speaker seemed perfect for her. The sound is loud and clear, as in, I can perfectly hear what she's listening to even while the shower is on and the door is closed.
Very good portable speaker. Accidentally dropped it in the tub and still works like the day I bought it. Sound quality is great and the battery life is really good. Lasts me for about four days without charging.
I am very pleased with this product. The sound quality is excellent with very good volume. I would never expect a speaker this small to provide the quality it does. I really like the portability. It is so small you can carry it in your coat pocket. I recently did some remodel work in a home and took it with me. I set it on a window sill, turned it on and loved being able to listen to music from my iPhone as I worked. I am also pleased with how easy the JUB speaker is when pairing with my phone. Highly recommend this item.
A lot of big clear sounds from a small portable speaker. JBL lives up to their reputation with this one. I am very happy with this purchase.
My husband likes to listen to his Bluetooth speaker at work and he specifically requested a JBL brand.  I ordered it for him for Father's Day.  He is pleased and loves the sound coming from that small, perfect sized speaker.  I was honestly surprised at the crisp, clear, loud sound.  He also said he feels the bass coming from it and he is happy with the product.  I would definitely recommend it!
The sound quality and the build quality are both quite amazing at this price point. It's loud enough for a room of 20 people hear good quality music. The water proof is quite useful which allows me to use it in shower. We bought 3, 1 for ourselves and 2 for the kids
These are great little speakers. The battery seems to last pretty long and the sound is better than using the speakers on your phone. I am going to watch for a sale and purchase more so they will be handy around the house.
Decent audio and Bluetooth connection. But this speaker broke 1 month later and Ive used it about 8-10 times. My $20 speaker lasted 10X longer than this and Im honestly pissed that I trusted it cause it was a popular brand.
Worked one time and then it would not turn on again.  The instructions with the speaker are useless, first of all you need a micro scope to read them.  No problem with the return, but who needs that headache.
Easily connects to Bluetooth on iPhone, has great sound for such a small unit. Battery time says 5 hours so its not too long with out needing a charge. Very loud to be so small. I love it.
Bought this to use in the shower. So far so good! The sound quality isnt the greatest comparing to a better portable speaker. But Its loud enough for me to make out all the news I need to hear. So given its size, Id say this is a really good buy!
i love my little speaker! i bought it so i could use it while i shower and watch Netflix! it is water resistant, but watch out because it can rust a bit from the front.
I purchased this to use as a speakerphone in my company car. The speaker and microphone are poor quality and cannot function in this role. It sounds like an old transister radio. Wasted money.
Good
This little thing is awesome. Cant believe the sound quality coming from such a tiny convenient speaker! Even bass sounds good!
This speaker exceeded my expectations. The sound quality was excellent and the volume went kindergarten I expected it to go. The size makes it easy to carry with you.
Gah! I love this thing! Small, light and very portable. Charge lasts quite long. Super loud, bluetooth works great! Worth the buy.
This is an excellent speaker. Period. That it is so small is amazing. Just got another one for my upstairs bedroom.
It's a good speaker. I should have done a little more research. I don't know when it is fully charged. There are no light indicators saying when it's fully charged. My concern is over charging and deteriorating the battery life.
Would give 0 stars if possible. Product arrived DEAD would no play via bluetooth, tested with my boyfriend's phone and mine. And would not play via aux cable, which wasnt included and also tested with my boyfriend's phone and mine. Refund requested.
I can't find a single negative thing to say about this Bluetooth speaker! The sound quality, water-resistance, and overall performance of my JBL GO 2 speaker is top for it's price!
The audio is quite muddy. Im very disappointed. It pairs quickly and easily with my phone and tablet, and Ive havent had to recharge it yet. But for listening to music, its just not very good. Im debating returning.
Great little speaker. Sound is good for such a small speaker. Great for being by poolside or bbq.
I was waiting to use more than once to give to you a fair review. I like the speaker, the sound is good but I don't know if it came defective but the speaker sometimes stops to work and I have to put the play again. Thats annoying. And also, I have the feeling that the battery dies very fast! Again, I love JBL brand, and thats why I got this speaker for my sister, but I truly dont know about this one. I guess Ill try to return! But good luck!
Great speakers for such a Small size. I should had bought more. Easy to pack unlike the JBL round which I also have. Comparing both I found the sound very similar. However , this one is cheaper and easier to pack for traveling.
I love it. Great for a bathroom while showering/getting ready. Sounds pretty good for a a tiny small thing. Connects very quickly to my phone too.
Would not connect with my computer. I have other things that work with Bluetooth, but not this speaker.
I got this as an extra Christmas gift for my husband since we said we needed something small for the beach this year. We used it at my sons birthday party and the sound was pretty good considering we didnt turn it up very loud and could still hear it over everyone talking. Its small and portable which is great Excited to try it out this summer since its waterproof.
Doesnt have the bass or the robust sound of a Bose, but the fact that its waterproof and its battery life make up for it
Sounds great and saves much space in tight area using as a personal DJ booth monitor. Easy to connect to system via cord or bluetooth!
I love JBL but I was skeptical wen I saw how small this speaker is. It has a AMAZING sound for the size! I love this thing! I haven't submerged it but I have showered with it and had it out in a down poor with no problems!
It's a cool little speaker but damn its small. The pictures are misleading, its honestly smaller than a sharpie. Maybe 3 inches long and 2 inches tall? I mean its cool but just a heads up its stupid small.
I probably used it a few times a month for about 3 months and then it stopped charging all together. Waste of money.
Works great, easy to use, sounds amazing and lasts a long time! Love taking this out kayaking for hours to listen to music as we go. Great little speaker!
I love this little box, its great sound and the blutooh reach. Very light and small enough to fit in my pocket, yet powerful
After 2 weeks, it s off, dead!! Recharging it but it just turn on 1 sec and turn off again!! Bad quality!! When you but it expect to use it for. Few weeks only
The battery life and driver power of this speaker are poor for the money you pay. I would say the Oontz speaker is the much better buy at this price point.
Seriously such a good speaker for the price! Not the kind of loud you want for a party but perfect for everyday use by the pool, or while youre cleaning your house etc. I dropped this thing to the bottom of a 10ft pool and it still works perfectly. I definitely recommend!
Really like the green color and the compactness. The sound quality is good but not as loud as I expected. Only because Im comparing to another speaker of mine that I was replacing it with. Which was valued around the same price. Overall it meets my needs and recommend.
Got it fir my granddaughter for Christmas.  I am glad to say she loves it.  I heard the sound from it and it us great.
Great little speaker. Actually wish it was a little bigger and a little louder. But pleasantly surprised. Will he used for outside and kitchen.
I use this little speaker all the time. It is a lot louder than I thought it would be. For personal listening it is awesome. If you are looking to entertain a room of people this is not what you are looking for. Overall,I am impressed with the sound quality, portability, and ease of use. Worth the purchase! I wish it supported dual function. I would buy another for sure!
Nice and small. Easy to set up. Sound is pretty good. Really loud for heavy rock songs it does ok, but still better than my little sony speaker. Would recommend for a small good quality speaker. If you want really good sound, the larger JBL speakers are amazing.
I've been wanting a more expensive brand portable speaker, and came across this one with great reviews.  It has great sound, which I was skeptical about after seeing the price.  Very impressed with the sound, charge it holds, and the price tag was perfect!  Highly recommend.
sounds good for a small speaker
This was a jackpot score! JBL sound is so good. Its small but packs a pretty mighty sound. Can I have a house dance party, probably not, can I crank up sometime loud and enjoy it, yes. It pairs with devices easily and was pretty quick to set up. I wish I would have bought another at the sale price I got it at! Well worth every penny.
It's the best shower speaker I've ever had. GREAT sound quality even as you turn the volume up. I usually only put mine in the shower when i'm actually taking one and be sure to dry off excess water and put it away when I'm done. I havent had any issues. Love it!
Could use more bass, very tinny.  Won't connect after 2 mos. of use. Sound started to go, lots of static, crackling. Don't bother. These days, there's no reason not to produce a quality product at a reasonable price. Especially a small speaker like this. It died. I bought it in June. Lasted 5 months.
This thing packs a punch! It also is pretty small, at about 3 inches Length, 1 inch width and 2.7 inches tall. It connects very quickly to bluetooth and I was pleasantly surprised with how great music sounds. I was not expecting such high quality.
I have never been disappointed with a jbl product. I had been looking for a bluetooth speaker on the smaller side that was waterproof. I had tried a few others and wasn't satisfied. I stumbled upon this wonderful speaker and was even more excited when I found they had it in my favorite color, orange! All in all, I am extremely satisfied with this speaker and can't recommend it enough.
I like this little speaker the sounds is the loudest but its loud enough and its battery life is better than the JBL Clip
I was feeling doubtful after ordering it since I read the comments last minute. But I must say that after it arrived and tested it out, I immediately had a smile on my face. It's loud and has some bass for a small speaker. It's really great for the price as well. I got the mint color and it's looks prettier in person and it feels so soft. I love it!
I bought this for my 12 year old daughter for Christmas. I heard music coming from her room and wheni opened the door she was listening to music on her new JBL GO2 Bluetooth speaker. I was really impressed with the sound quality and you can actually feel and hear the bass! I will probably buy another one for myself for ice fishing. The waterproof is great!
Its small but mighty. My husband uses it in garage & workshop & its great. Puts off good sound quality. Connects to Bluetooth smoothly.
I have the JBL flip and purchased this to use in my office. This is very small, but powerful and $40 less than the flip.  It comes with a bright orange charger which is easy to find among all of the chargers in my life. Im very pleased with this product and I would recommend it.
Bought this for my son as part of his birthday gift. I've bought him several through the years & none of them seemed to last longer than a few months. 2 of which were the price of this one so I wasn't sure how it would actually sound and hold up. I figured I couldn't go wrong with this brand, they make quality products. He is pleased with this speaker & so am I. I would purchase again.
Well I hookup to my cellphone Bluetooth started leasting to music left cellphone in house took speaker outside walk about 1000ft and I could still hear it playing its very loud, battery life is longer than headphones.
Good for personal use in a very small area, sound isnt as good or as loud as the jbl charge, kinda wish I wouldve paid extra & went with the charge 4.
I have this for a month or so.... dont know how many portable speakers ive bought. I work in a kitchen. Great sound and loudness & bass for a pocket size speaker. Sometimes have to turn it down. Fits perfectly in just about any pocket and light weight. So far seems pretty durable.
If you're looking for something that sounds like a Bose for $30, you're out of luck.  However, I was shocked at how good this little (solidly manufactured) speaker actually sounded; especially the bass.  For music, I've been happy,  but I'm especially impressed with the sound quality of phone calls.  For the price, I'd recommend it.
What can I say. For the price and for the size, its an unbelievable speaker. So small and light you can take it virtually anywhere. I was really surprised the quality of the sound even at higher volumes.  Outdoors it does loose some of its punch. Absolutely perfect for travel.
So this item was really good with sound quality but the batteries are messed up, i guess. It lasted for almost 2 months, then It just stopped charging. Unknown cause but all I know, it was beeping when its battery low and at one point, it just turned off and never charge again. We used all that we can to charge it but no luck. So its back in its box, and stowed away --- unusable. We did enjoy using it for the 2 months it lasted.
Best little BIG Sounding JBL speaker, Sounds awesome and great quality, Very happy with this purchase.
This was a decent speaker for the price. Fairly full sound for the size and extremely durable. My only complaint is it walks... walked straight into eternity off my kitchen counter into oblivion and survived. Turn it up too loud and its dancing as much as you are so secure this cute little speaker!
It doesnt hold a charge very long at all and disconnects from Bluetooth while using it and charging at the same time. Sound quality and volume is decent. For the price it is about what I expected but disappointing.
Handy little speaker. I use it while I tan and in the shower, etc. Nice sound for a tiny speaker. Seems to have a decent battery life, as Ive only had to charge a few times and has been used a lot. May buy a few more as gifts.
I love this speaker. It connects effortlessly to my phone and the battery lasts a long time. I've kept it in the kitchen to use while cooking over the weekend and didn't have to charge it again until Sunday night. I've purchased portable speakers before and they're always either bad sound or die after an hour. The sound is so much better than expected on this speaker, the bass is good and it never gets pingy and its waterproof! I highly recommend this little speaker, its a pretty color too!
For the size, this is a great sounding speaker. Very lightweight, and easy to pack to travel.  I learned about this speaker when I recently traveled with three of my children and they all had this speaker. I ordered two when I returned. Love all the color options.
I typically don't give anything 5 stars, but this product is excellent! The sound quality in this speaker is SO great for the price and it is durable and stylish. We purchased this on Balck Friday for our 10 year old to use with her tablet, and she absolutely loves it. I will definitely consider buying JBL products in the future.
Small  and yet very decent sound and good volume.  Battery life is good enough for my purposes but perhaps not for a full day out.  Good design and feels fine in the hand.  Good for music, excellent for audiobooks!
Everyone likes how small and personal this speaker is...you can splash next to the pool and it is safe as well...good sound quality for the size
Wow ! Great Sound. I expected this thing to be a little bigger honestly, however upon using it delivered great sound quality for what it is. I just needed a speaker for the long showers. And  i am more than happy.
Read reviews and they were right.  Great sound, quick charging.  Can't wait to use it by pool. It died sad it was great but did not last.  All the trouble shooting did not work.
Its okay. It gets a bit tinny when turned up all the way and Isnt super loud, but will for sure work in the shower (what I got it for). I just wish it came with some suction cups or magnets or something to stick it to the wall with.
Overall it's a nice little speaker.  However, it automatically shuts down after 5 to 10 minutes of inactivity.  JBL says there is no way to stop this behavior.
It sounds like my favorite band was miniaturized and are playing live right inside my speaker! The water resistant rating is for 1 meters deep for 30 min, sound travels 4 times after inbound water!
The quality is good for what it is.  There is a little static if turned up all of the way with a phone. But it's not that noticable I would've never known if my bf didn't point it out. I think it's well worth it. Loud and durable.
I love the size and convenience of this speaker. Sound isn't bad for the size. If you're looking for loud, get the next one up. This is perfect for what we needed.
This speaker is perfect to use at the office, on a picnic, the beach, or take with you for cocktail hour at your neighbors backyard!  Would make an excellent Christmas gift if you need an idea for someone on your hard to buy for list, secret Santa, etc. Sounds great, battery is long lasting and the plus is it's water resistance!
For such a small package the sound quality is excellent. Plenty of bass, much better that listening to music on iPhone alone. Also, a great iPhone speakerphone. Very impressed, and JBL is a great company
Bought this to listen to music while doing chores around the house. Range on it is good and it is definitely water proof; Ive dunked it a few times by accident and it worked the entire time. Rubber port cover can be difficult to get off if you dont have nails or are fat fingered like me, but it dors keep the water out!
I bought this on July 30th 2019. I paid $39.95 and wouldve expected it to last at least a few years. I am disappointed in the quality of its life. It sounded good while it was working but it will no longer charge. Ive tried several outlets and changers to no avail. Buyer beware!
