{"text": "Comes with: -  USB A to C cable -  Stereo audio cable -  Airline adapter -  Protective case Noise cancelling is unbelievable.  This is my first set of noise cancelling headphones and I had no idea that this technology was possible.  I am no longer skeptical.  Because headphones use type USB C, they charge very quickly.  I was worried that these headphones would produce too much bass.  By adjusting the sound settings on the transmitting device (phone, computer, mp3 player), the headphones will give the desired sound. These were the headphones that I really wanted, but I did not want to spend more than $200.  When I saw that I could get these headphones for $240 instead  of $350, I decided not to sweat over $40.  These are by far the best headphones I have ever used.\n"}
{"text": "My first set of NC headphones. Tosse due between these and the Bose QC35II. Came down to price as friends with both said for my intended use of noise cancelling and media streaming I wouldn't know the difference. I love them! I find the hand controls on the ear cup to be a cinch to use and convenient. Rapid charge is great for a quick top up. Noise cancelling is great. So much so my wife hates it as I now apparently click my tongue or smack my lips, breath too loudly and be generally more irritating as I can't hear anything. The sound quality is great. Ive increased the amount of music I listen to 10 fold as the ease of having the headphones on to knock out back ground noise and have high quality sound makes it worthwhile to throw these on and get to work. The ap gives you ability to modify the setting headphone settings. All the same to me really but the options are there.\n"}
{"text": "Bulls*** I have the Chinese version of my headphones not the international version. This is a scam.\n"}
{"text": "I have an awful time focusing with lots of ambient noise.  I have a new roommate that loves to watch TV at max volume, and I was really struggling to study at home (where I happen to study best in a normal situation).  These are an absolute godsend, and if I'm at home or at school I'm never without them. They have better sound quality than my senheiser 599's, and the sound canceling is astounding.  I would 100% recommend them to anyone who needs to focus in hectic situations.  This is the best purchase I have made in years.\n"}
{"text": "Everything is top score here except the freaking call quality. Start a call and the noise cancelling mics switch roles and turn into microphones instead for the call and they pick up TONNES of outside noise. Louder than you would normally hear that and it brings all that right into your headphones. The caller hears you ok but you will hear everything happening outside louder than if you weren't wearing headphones. That, for me, is an incredible turn off and disappointment. But everything else is fantastic and may be the best available right now. I've tried many.\n"}
{"text": "I purchased these about a month ago and tested them in many different environments. The plastic does feel super cheap and is very squeaky. The sound quality is pretty good but has a shallowness to it that seems to be filled in with unwanted amounts of bass. The fact that you can only connect to one device at a time is the real deal breaker, and to top it off it is very difficult to switch to a new device. You have to turn the headphones off(5 seconds), hold two buttons for 7 seconds, turn the head phones back on, and then re-connect them to the new device. The earmuffs have severely deflated over the last month and seem much less comfortable than my 3 year old Qc35 bose headphones. I've actually went back to my raggity old QC-35's and they are so much better. If you're debating getting these, I really wouldn't, I also bought the bose 400 and they suck too. Stick with QC-35 series II, or wait for the next product. It feels like they both raced to get these products out without much testing.\n"}
{"text": "I absolutely love these headphones, the sound quality and noise cancelling is so amazing the best product I ever heard! I would highly recommend these for those who appreciate all the sounds and instruments in the music they listen to, truly an Amazing listening experience, a little high priced, AND  whoever thought a 2 charge cord was a good idea should be fired from Sony! And the guy that approved the guy who thought the cord of 2 was a good idea should also be fired! Why a 2 charging cord? Sony should reinvent this idea of a 2 cord and make it at least 3ft and give the new charge cord FREE to those that have purchased these earphones! The charge cord is actually a real funny joke! Come on Sony seriously you really dropped the ball on the charge cord! Such Dorks! Excellent product I would highly recommend! And would purchase again! Very happy customer! Except for the ridiculous charge cord!\n"}
{"text": "SONY, if you fix the one device problem, this is easily a five star item. It sounded superb as advertised and the noise cancellation is just phenomenal. After some initial difficulties, it now works and I am pleased. What I have learned about this device however is: IT ONLY WORKS WITH ONE DEVICE AT A TIME. To change devices you have to first disconnect from the first device and then connect to the second device. Sometimes even this doesn't work and you have to make the first device \"forget this device\" and then repeat the whole pairing process later. The M4 apparently may have addressed these issues but not this model. So no intelligent auto-switching between devices like you'd get with AirPods and perhaps Bose and other products. Very dissappointing for a high end product and not forgivable even if I am still willing to work with this limitation. That said, I am keeping it because I have some AirPods Pro if I really need quick and easy device switching and this device is just so superb at what is does well.\n"}
{"text": "Overall, these are a great pair of headphones. Noise Cancelling: these headphones do an awesome job cancelling out the noise around you, and the experience is super customizable using the Sony app - you can set how much noise you want to come through. Works great for cancelling out the noise of an office/household around you. However, I haven't tested them on airplane noise or something like that. Sound Quality: I'm no audiophile, but quality sound is important to me. These headphones deliver, with a nice balanced sound (my opinion). The sound mix is customizable using the app. Control: I was kind of worried about the touch panel control on these because of the lack of tactile buttons for controlling volume & controlling your music. It was annoying at first, but I've gotten used to it. I've seen some people complaining about cold weather making the touch panel go crazy, but Sony pushed an update to the app that lets you turn off the panel to fix that issue. Also, if you want to turn the volume up/down by a large margin, you can swipe up/down and hold your finger there after the swipe to have the volume continue changing (instead of having to do 100 swipes). Looks: I was a little bummed they didn't have any options besides the silver and the black, but the silver ones I got are pretty good looking in person. A little more matte colored than they appear in the product image. The carrier case they come with matches the color of the headphones well & does a good job of holding all the cords and things as well.\n"}
{"text": "first off, when these arrived everything was in Chinese(international version?). needed to download the app and switch it to English. i got these for the noise canceling and they work perfectly. i work from my computer in my living room because i have no office. i cant get any work done because my family is using the tv and their cell phones all together the room is almost unbearable. now i only hear what i need to hear!\n"}
{"text": "I did a ton of research on wireless headphones and landed on these and I have not been disappointed! Years ago I tried Sennheisers similar offering and was disappointed with the sound quality and ease of use. In hindsight, I should've adjusted my expectations. The good: - If you are not using the microphone, the sound quality is very good, even if the frequency response is not flat - Extremely comfortable - Somehow does not get hot and sweaty after long usage - Noise cancellation is great and is seriously more helpful than I imagined while working from home - Microphone quality is great (even with a little bit of quiet hissing due to the mics being buried in the headphones) - The companion app (on iOS) is easy to use and has every setting I need - Comes with a nice case and all cables you need - Battery that could last you two full workdays - Works with wireless and wired modes The not-so-good: - Wireless headphones using bluetooth cannot allow you to listen to high quality sound while using the microphone, but that's a product of bluetooth and not these headphones specifically. I had the same problem w/ my Sennheisers years back -- just know this before you buy -- these are NOT gaming headphones. - The default setting has an announcer in your ear for every action you take. It can take 5 seconds for her to finish speaking before ANC is disabled etc. This can be disabled, thankfully, and I did so immediately from the app. - The touch controls can be a bit fiddly, so I typically leave them disabled All in all, these are perfect for me.\n"}
{"text": "These are the headphones to get! The work amazingly well, I would offer they are better at eliminating background noise than either the Bose 25 and 35 units (can't compare to the new 700s). I got these then had a 15 hour flight to Israel from SFO through FRA and really got a chance to put them to the test. I used the included cable to listen to the seat back entertainment (until United had a problem and none of our row had any entertainment!) So I switched to bluetooth and streamed an audiobook from my phone for the remainder of the flight which was about 10 hours. The battery never went below 50%, so it seems that their claim of 20 hours is conservative! I played with the ambient noise reduction and the noise cancellation, both are good for different reasons. You can hear the flight attendants speak when they come through the row with the noise reduction, but when you really want some quiet time, press the button on the bottom of the left ear cup and activate the noise cancelling. Fantastic! It also works nicely with the available phone app (ios and Android), but it's not really necessary, although I did need to turn off the automatic activity detection which confused me for the first hour of use. When the plane climbed and the cabin pressure changed, the headphones detected the pressure change and changed modes. The same system also tries to figure out if you aare walking, sitting still, driving or riding and adjusts accordingly. It makes sense and could be useful, but for a plane flight where the only change was cabin pressure, turning off that feature sorted things out. That feature can only be controlled via the app, so make sure you have it installed before you use these headphones on a long trip. I can also report that you can sleep with them on, just don't press them against the bulkhead as the vibrations of the engines will transfer to them and mess up the noise cancellation. I found a position that worked pretty well (I had a window seat). Unlike other headphones, my ears were not uncomfortable or sweaty wearing them for multiple hours. I can't say the same with the Bose. Finally, I'd read that some people had problems pairing these to multiple devices. I have them paired to a Samsung Note 8 and an iPad Pro and didn't have any problems switching between devices. That had been my biggest concern, but it's a non-issue. Very glad I got these headphones, made the flight much more bearable.\n"}
{"text": "Man...these are amazing. I just used them through a trip to Japan, HongKong, and Macau and they were super comfortable and nice to have. They fit amazingly well and sound incredible. They also block out a ton of noise and if you play any sound/music, you wont even notice other sounds. I was in places with crying babies and stuff and these things were so good. Also, they are easy to clean. Just take a wet wipe and cream them easily. They also charged super fast and lasted a very long time. I got these for this recent trip but I had no idea that I would actually like these so much as my daily driver. I didnt know I could sync them up to the Apple TV when I bought them. So now, these have become my fav pair of headphones. I wear them around the house, work, and during travel. Make sure you read how to pair them with multiple devices, its easy. Lots of people seem to be confused about that, include famous YouTubers who reviewed these. Also, when you enter a noisy environment like an airplane, make sure you go into the settings and calibrate them to your environment. It made a difference for me sometimes when it measures some stuff and provided a better noise cancellation. I didnt think I was a Bluetooth type of person, I usually prefer corded headphones but yea once I tried these and realized how freeing it is just to move around in the house and listen to my music or Apple TV without any issues, I fell in love. One thing about quality, I highly recommend that you try these over cheaper products. I know money is an issue with this purchase because they arent cheap. I did try multiple cheaper brands and the noise cancellation and music quality to be sub-par. You so get what you pay for with these. I feel like if I take care of them, these will last me a very long time and because they are so nice, comfortable, stylish, and great sounding, I will actually use them. I have another wired set of planar headphones which I got so that I could listen to music at home, but I never use them because they are heavy and they tether me to the area Im in. I didnt consider the freeing nature of cordless but its amazing and you will use these far more than you think you will. Just get em. Id youre in the market, trust me, just get them. Also, Im gonna upload a video review on YouTube...so come check it out search for Aman Bansil and youll find my channel.\n"}
{"text": "I loved these while I was listening to music.  The sound is amazing.  They are extraordinarily comfortable.  The build quality is impressive.  I loved them.  And then I tried to make a call with them.  It sounded like I was underwater.  I thought I had a defective product.  I got a replacement.  Something, horrible microphone.  I searched online and saw that is a known limitation and not a defect.  Search youtube for sound comparisons.  If you need to make calls, get the Bose.\n"}
{"text": "It's hard to know where to begin actually. I've owned several pairs of ANC headphones over the years and by and large, I've been seriously underwhelmed. They all worked to some degree or another, but there was always SOMETHING about them that just didn't \"work\" for me. Not comfortable, the ANC was too weak. The audio quality was poor/terrible, etc. The honest truth is, people seem to believe that ANC is necessary under circumstances where they really aren't needed, and are under the false impression that it somehow makes the music sound better. That is simply untrue. All ANC does is allow you to concentrate better on the audio under circumstances where the ambient noise around you makes it difficult, such as on a plane flight. In truth, audio quality and ANC are separate things altogether. These are the international version, and therefore, they came out of the box with Chinese being the language you hear whenever you turn them on/off. This is a simple correction via the app, so don't worry if you cannot understand anything at first. The app is in English, so give it a thorough run-thru so you will know about what to expect. You may need an immediate firmware or software update. With the XM3's, via bluetooth, these updates can be excruciatingly L-O-N-G. Have patience, but DO keep that in mind. It can take 30-45 minutes or possibly a little longer. Mine came with the latest update pre-loaded, and for that I was grateful. Let's start with audio quality, since that is the #1 reason to buy a pair of headphones. As a Sony fan and a radio broadcaster with 30 years of experience, I can say without reservation that Sony makes some of the best all-around headphones you can buy, period. Some audiophiles may say different, but the honest truth is, audio quality is almost as much subjective as it is a fact for some. No audiophile listens to music with headphones on more than I have over the last 30 years, I can tell you that. But everyone is slightly different and your tastes may vary...this is important to remember. The XM3's sound phenomenal. Great bass, low's, mid's and highs were fairly crisp and punchy. It all fades a bit when the ANC is enabled however, so keep that in mind. You sacrifice a little audio for the noise cancellation on, so don't be shocked...but it isn't a lot. It still sounds great. It could be a bit louder perhaps, but that didn't bug me at all. I was particularly grateful that Sony includes a cord which you can use for listening to audio on a plane, or for me, to plug into my control board at my radio station (though I needed an adapter, which is standard for broadcasting, so I have several). Not all ANC headphones come with this option (Bose 700 for instance...) ANC...wow. When they say Industry Leading, they aren't kidding. I was busy adjusting my app when a coworker came in and walked up to me and I didn't even hear them enter and ask me a question. When I suddenly registered I wasn't alone in my studio, I nearly jumped out of my skin. Holy friggin' cow. That ANC WORKS! You can of course adjust it all via the app and by cupping your hand over the right earpiece and the audio almost immediately lowers and the ANC turns off and you can hear your surroundings. It's actually quite amazing how good this works. One thing I dislike about noise cancelling is how many experience a \"pressure\" on your ears when it turns on. This is something I have always just lived with, but was constantly annoyed by. The XM3's have all but eliminated this. It was turned on by default, so I hardly even recognized it until I found the function in the app. Well done Sony. As for comfort, as someone who is fairly used to wearing headphones for literally hours-on-end in my studio, I place a higher standard on comfort than perhaps many others. If I'm going to wear something for this long each day, they certainly better be comfortable. What good is great audio quality if the comfort isn't there? You may not place comfort as high on the list of \"must haves\" when you buy headphones, but for me, it very well may be the most important factor, and one I forget to mention all too often. The XM3's are genuinely comfortable. Keep in mind everyone is different, so what is great for some may not be for all...but the premium build certainly helps. Not sure what the earcups are made of, soft leather, a fake simulation...? I dunno. But they sure are soft. Light YEARS better than the cheap one's Sony includes on their Professional Studio Monitors (MDR 7506). As with pretty much ANY over-the-ear headphones, the better the seal, the hotter they tend to be the warmer the outside temp happens to be. After prolonged wear, you may experience some ear sweat (I don't know any other way to put it). I find that if it's going to be that warm, I remove them often in between songs to help keep that issue to a minimum. But as for sheer comfort, Sony has nailed it here. I could wear these all day. I briefly considered the XM4's, but for the added price, the advantages weren't significant enough for me to want to pay the extra. For my particular needs/wants, the XM3's are more than sufficient...plus, they are around $150 cheaper, and honestly, for this price, money talks. Having tried on a pair of the XM4's, I can say the ANC functionality seems no different to me. There ARE several other things they come with that the older model doesn't have, so keep that in mind, but audio-quality wise, the difference is essentially nil. They both sound great. The XM3's come with a carrying case! It seems that of all the expensive headphones I've bought over the years, many either come with a pouch, or nothing at all and this is flat-out bothersome...especially considering what some cost (Master & Dynamic, I'm looking at YOU). Nice to have an included case that allows you to fold your cans up sufficiently so that the case doesn't take up much room wherever you plan to store/carry them. Nice touch, Sony. Yes, I've seen better cases, but I've also seen much, MUCH worse, so no issues in this dept as far as I'm concerned. I got the silver version, but I'm not exactly sure how they came up with this description. Either someone at Sony is colorblind, or attempting to pull a joke on us because these are decidedly NOT silver. Sort of a light tan/brown color yes...but absolutely NOT silver. It's almost a joke they even chose to go with this as the color description. Seriously, what gives, Sony?? I do not use my XM3's for calling, so I cannot comment on call quality, but from everything I've heard, this is one area where Sony could use some work. Being able to pair multiple devices simultaneously isn't something I have ever had to do, so if I'm being honest, it isn't an issue for me. With that said however, I am a little surprised it was not included. the Sony XM3 ANC earbuds have it (and they came out close to the same time as their bigger headphone counterparts), and it's been tech that has been around far longer than the headphones have, so I'm a little mystified they did not make it a standard feature. Especially when you consider that Sony HAD to know a good number of their direct competitors would be including it and going after all the potential consumers who viewed this as a deal-breaker...but may have otherwise purchased a pair. Seriously, they have lost a literal mint by not including it, and that simply does not make sense to me. I love how Sony included an adapter for plane flight to plug into in case you wish to watch video next time you fly across country. Several other (more expensive) models do not offer this as even an option, making the headphones useless for this specific purpose on flights. Many will be okay with this simply because they'll use theirs for watching content on their smartphones instead, but dang, it's nice to have as an option for either/or that the Bose 700 doesn't even offer. Could be a deal breaker for some. Build quality can be subjective for some. The honest truth is, I take VERY GOOD care of my good headphones, and as a result, they last. My Professional Studio Monitors (the MDR 7506's I mentioned earlier) I have had for 8+ years and they not only look as good as they did when I bought them, but they still sound absolutely fantastic (I did however, replace the ear cushions, the ones that come standard are just plain crap on those models...I got some memory foam versions and they have been perfect). Take care of your cans and you will get many years worth of use out of them. For what they charge these days, it's important to treat them well if you wish to truly get the most out of them. I don't use mine for exercise (I don' think they would stay in place well enough for any type of vigorous activity, but that goes for essentially any over-the-ear headphones that I'm aware of) so I don't have to worry about that. But I fold mine up after each use and put them away carefully. I also have a headphone stand I hang them from while I'm at work, so they get plenty of TLC. If you tend to be more harsh on your headphones, keep in mind the result will most certainly be a shorter lifespan, and for some that'll be upsetting, but like I said, take care of them, and they'll last...it's as simple as that. I'm sure I'll have updates, but so far, Sony knocked this one out of the park BIG time.\n"}
{"text": "The only thing that is important for me in headphones is the noise cancelling, which is why I bought these. The reviews glorify these headphones, and researching noise cancelling headphones always circles back to the Sony WH-1000XM3, so after using IEM (in ear monitors) for a long time, I decided to buy the WH-1000XM3. In my opinion, they get the job done, but not like I expected them to. While i was hoping that it would block out talking, I know that this is pretty much considered black magic at this point, so I did not expect that from these headphones. It does happen to some degree, though. I see that if you turn on the NC (noise cancelling) function and turn on the volume to a certain point (about a 1/3 of the total volume, or even lower maybe) you can easily tune out people talking even next to you, so that is nice. It's pretty much a combination of somewhat loud music and NC function turned on that does that. What I am disappointed about is the inadequate functioning of the ANC (active noise cancelling) function. If you look up ANC you will probably see an image with sound waves and opposite sound waves sent by the headphones to counter the outside noise. What we're being told is that any *consistent* outside noise (a plane engine humming for example) would be completely eradicated, and we won't hear it. I am taking a bus everyday to work. In reality, with NC turned on, I still hear the bus engine pretty well, just muffled. I will admit that I am hearing soft, relaxing music at low volumes, but I don't see how that matters. It seems to me that ANC is supposed to eliminate constant noise, so I am baffled on why I'm still hearing the bus engine. The touch buttons and gestures are a very nice touch, and I am glad I can use them. Being able to turn on both the headphones and the Bluetooth on my phone by just using the NFC (putting my phone against the left side of the headphones) is really cool and I love that as well. I cannot comment on sound quality as I am not an audiophile. It just sounds fine, no problems I've noticed. TL;DR - product is really good, ANC is disappointing.\n"}
{"text": "This is a common problem with the WH-1000XM3 and it seems also according to comments the WH-1000XM4 as well.  It seems very hit or miss if you get this issue or not, but after a bit of wearing, less than maybe 20 minutes for me, it develops this noise/crackle sound in the right ear.  From what I have found it is some defect that does not allow the headphones to function properly if the humidity gets too high in the cups, so this would likely be perfect for non humans, and likely non organic lifeforms, like robots or something.  Sony really needs to test things with real humans for longer terms than apparently they do. The sound quality and ANC was amazing for the first 15 minutes!  I really wanted to like and use these, but just no, I can't.\n"}
{"text": "Been using them for a couple months ths now and so far HOLY CRAP they are awesome! The noise cancelation is insane, as is the clarity. The bass isn't going to rattle your head off, it's deep, loud, but more importantly clear. You can truly hear the difference in bass levels. My audiophile friend recommends these so you know they're great! Came in nice case, universal attachments, and a chord. Uses USB-C, charges completely in relatively quickly, don't think I've ever had to charge them for longer than an hour and a half or so, and I've never ran out of battery, even though I use them at least 10 hours a day. I'll take it off the charger, use them on my way to work, work 6 hours, drive home, and watch a few movies before bed and they won't even be under 70% after all that. Lastly using them for so long every day, they've never been uncomfortable. Took one star away solely because the language the headphones use is in Chinese. It would be nice to understand the noise cancelation modes and when it's attempting to pair. But hey, for the money, I can deal with it!\n"}
{"text": "For all its nifty touch gestures, Sony talked miserably on providing proper multiple device support, I had to troll thru myriad forums to finally get an answer, as official Sony support forums woukd act dumb and respond with a how to pair multiple devices instead of answering the real question which was can jy be hioked up to 2 devices at the same time. It supports it, somewhat, in a hobbled fashion, you can have one device set for ohone calls puck up, and thenither for medianto the. Headset!!!. The much older QC35, not even 2, supports this with ease. Justnfor that, and for not makingnit clear, i give this a 2 star. The noise cancellation is actually very good. Only 0.8 ounce heavier than the qc35, it does feel much heaviee to wear though. And also, the mic, us as good as useless for phone calls\n"}
{"text": "I owned a pair of Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear Headphones. I was very happy with them and only replaced them because I had sat on them one too many times (note to self, don't leave them lying on the sofa, recliner, or bed -- you will sit on them). I probably went with the Beats for their coolness factor. Also, a friend let me listen to theirs, and they definitely had some bass thump going on, and I kind of like that. This time, I did some research and the Sony WH-1000XM3 Wireless Noise Canceling Headphones were rated \"best overall\" by several sites so I went with them. It was a very close decision between these and the Bose QuietComfort 35 II Wireless Bluetooth Headphones. The tipping point was the app-controlled ability to boost bass. Sound Quality Right off the bat, I gotta say the sound quality and noise cancelling is better than the Beats. Not trashing the Beats, I loved them, but there does seem to be better separation and detail, and the noise cancelling does not have the hiss that the Beats had. Indeed, I cannot even hear things like the microwave or vacuum with the headphones on. Might be kind of dangerous out in the world. As a note, it took a long time to charge out of the box (probably the full 3 hours, though I don't know for sure. I fell asleep at some point, and they were charged when I woke-up). This is not a negative, just a note. There were clear notes indicating it might take a while. The APP Now for a negative. It almost cost a star, but since I did get it resolved, and all it cost me was some frustration, I decided not to. When I installed the app, it told me right away that there was an update, and it continuously nagged me to download and install it. I attempted this many (many) times but it kept saying \"failed download\". This was especially frustrating since the headphones were speaking to me in Japanese (this might be because I ordered the \"International Version/Seller Warrant\" version), and I also got the \"failed download\" message when I tried to change that in the app. I even uninstalled the app, reinstalled it, and still no worky. After many many attempts, it finally began updating. I have no idea what finally fixed it. Maybe the app registers itself with Sony and it takes a bit for that process to take. If so, there should be a warning. As a note, the update itself took forever. I think I got through an entire episode of Gilmore Girls (guilty pleasure, not sorry). When finally updated the app indicated that the headphones had zero battery, and that prevented me from changing the language. Turned out, the battery wasn't really low. Simply powering the headphones off and back on fixed that. Finally, attempted changing language again, and, like the update, it worked this time. It too, took a while, though not near as long as the update. Once again, when complete, the app indicated I was at 0% battery again, and once again cycling the headphones fixed this. Explored the app. It has presets (bright, excited, bass boost, etc.). Excited and Bass Boost were my favorites. I settled on bass boost (as you probably could guess from my previous remarks). It was pretty good right out of the box (i.e. no app enhancement) but it was worth the hassle of getting the app to work just for the bass boost. I haven't explored the noise canceling optimizer or other sound controls--I'll report back if I discover anything noteworthy. Comfort The comfort is perfectly acceptable, perhaps slightly better than my beloved Beats, though I personally have yet to experience a set of headphones whose comfort match the hype associated with their reviews.\n"}
{"text": "Pulled the trigger when these showed up in my feed for $264 brand new. Is the international version which has absolutely no difference on hardware or software. The difference is the manuals different languages and warranty. Background: Im not a sound snob but I am into tech. When it comes to music I got used to decent sound quality since all my cars usually have either Bose or Harman kardon or, Beats , and my girlfriend has the Bose QC35s which i compared to these(picture attached). All this has set a inadvertent baseline for my music/sound. On the sound side these have a bit more bass than the Bose but the Bose feel more comfortable(not by much) On the Tech side these blow Bose out of the water. The Sony App has a lot of functionality. Additionally I was a skeptic when it came to the touch controls on these, but I immediately became a fan! Noise canceling I honestly feel the QC35 beat the Sony on this department but once again this is barely negligible. The tie breaker for me: putting hand over the right ear which allows ambient sound enabling the user to hear everything without taking the headphones off. This feature is awesome! Overall you cant go wrong with either! Both sound excellent and do excellent noise canceling.\n"}
{"text": "out of the box; these headphones are absolutely fantastic. comfortable. a little hot in the summer, but great otherwise. the noise cancellation is incredible. I couldn't hear my window air conditioner, or even the lawnmower in front of me while I cut the grass. near perfect sound quality. much better sound quality than Bose qc35ii. abient sound mode worked perfect. after the update though.... noise cancellation barely works. I can hear my fingers snapping... it used to drown out a lawnmower! the Bose headphones would now have much better noise cancellation I'm sad to say. the ambient sound control is messed up now too. it used to pick up voices well, and traffic by the side walk sounded clear... after the update it seems to drown out cars and people, but accentuates white noise like air conditioning and fridge condensers clicking on. WTF!? how is that useful? that's what I want to drown out. why would Sony do this? why would they destroy a wonderful pair of headphones that cost 350$? the new xmh4 headphones have just been announced. sony may actually be screwing up their best headphones on purpose to give people a reason to spend more money. it's really pretty underhanded and shameful. it's still possible to get the best ambient sound control and noise cancellation, but you will have to sacrifice some other features they added to the app later on. you can downgrade the headphone firmware, but it's kind of a pain. you could also buy a fresh new pair and refuse to update them. they really do have great potential. sony might fix it eventually, but who knows. I think these headphones actually still deserve a 3.5 or maybe even 4 out of 5 but I feel forced to give them a 1 due to Sony's bizzare approach to customer service and product support. if it's not broken, don't fix it. imagine if you looked outside and saw a guy in a Honda jumpsuit taking the brakes off your car, and he was putting on much worse brakes, and told you they were somehow improved even though you are more likely to crash. I kinda feel like that's similar to sony reducing the ambient sound control's ability to hear nearby traffic in an update, stating that it improves battery life when it obviously doesn't. much like the fictitious man in a jumpsuit sealing your brakes, all of the sudden not being able to hear nearby cars, when you were used to being able to hear them from pretty far away, could potentially be dangerous. I realize that comparison is a pretty big stretch, but it's not a good look. things like that are problems I expect the HIGHLY paid audio engineers at Sony to take into consideration when I buy such an expensive pair of headphones. I would have sent them back for a refund, but I installed the update 4 days after the return window so I'm screwed. Sony: fix my headphones and I very gladly take down this review. until then I guess I'll be hearing alot of my neighbors and landscaping tools... cool.\n"}
{"text": "I tried many headphones, including the Boss QuietComfort 35 II and this by far is the best. The noise cancellation works way way way better than the Boss, the cup the right ear feature to interrupt the music and talk to my wife without taking it off is amazing, swipe to adjust the volume is easier, sound quality is great but I am not a musician to tell the difference, love the bass (some musicians said it's fake bass in the review but I thought it is way better than Boss 35 II), bluetooth connection is way more reliable and almost double the range compared to the Boss 35 which drops out sometimes even when I am next to my computer, this has a softer clamp and way more comfortable than the Boss which I thought was the best at the time.  This is the ultimate headphone for me but may be not for you since I live in S. California which never goes below 32 degrees F and I do not use the microphone to answer calls. Buy this according to your needs and situations, there is no perfect headphones out there. The price keeps on going up, I think the demand is extremely high but at the same time there are many returns ( open boxes on Ebay) mostly I belief because people tried to use it below freezing. I did a calculation without the malfunction below freezing negative reviews, this headphone would have been easily 5 stars. Returned 2 Boss QuietComfort II, my son's and mine and very happy with these which I purchased one at Ebay sealed new for $255 and one at Amazon international version sealed new for $283.\n"}

{"text": "I have been using the H.ear on 2 (WH-H900N OEM refurbished) since February 2019. I kept hearing how the WH-1000XM3's were far better and warranted a look. I held off since I had absolutely no issues with the H900N. Finally I gave in and ordered the XM3's. Yes, the XM3's are better, but not at everything, and depending on what you are looking for, the H900N may be a far better option and here is why. *Price: $100.00 WH-H900N OEM refurbished $250.00 WH-1000XM3 International version Both prices are deeply discounted. One due to refurbishment and the other due to no US warranty. *Build and materials: For me this is a toss up. While the H900n is heavier and thicker and far harder to forget that they are on your head, that weight and girth gives you a feeling of durability/quality and over the last year of using these everyday, they look as new as the day I received them. The ear cuff foam and the fake leather are far better and more substantial on the H900N. The 1000XM3 is lighter and that adds to the comfort, but I prefer thicker ear pads for my ear shape and head size. I prefer the H900N here but not by a large margin. *Sound This is a toss up for me. I use both with equalizer profiles off to allow for DSEE HX. They both sound about the same while the H900N have a little more bass and the 1000XM3 provide a little more separation. Volume is nearly equal on both. No clear winner hear for me. I can go either way. *Mic, calls, assistant, connection Equally terrible on both. I will not use either for calls unless I absolutely have to. They both use Google assistant with newest updates. They both connect equally well to my PC and Phone,tablets. No audio delay in Youtube other video on my PC or phone. Toss up here. *Battery, charging While I have never drained either set, They both reach about 50% around the same usage time. The area where the 1000XM3 shines is that I can fully charge 50% in 20 minutes or so with a 30w PD charger. Also the 1000XM3 uses USB-C while the H900n uses M-USB. With the H900N it takes roughly 1 -1.5 hours to charge from 50% to full. This doesn't matter that much to me since I can still get a week or more of use, but it's nice to know I can get 5 hrs of run time on only a few minutes of charge with the 1000XM3. 1000XM3 wins easily here. *Noise cancellation The 1000XM3 are superior here, by a good margin. If the XM3 are 100% at noise cancelling, I would put the H900n at 75%. The XM3 kill low even noise, but both are limited in what they can do for voices, like all ANC headsets. With that said, the 1000XM3 are better across the board. I don't use the active noise cancelling, it is not very consistent. XM3 wins. *Conclusion For me, the H900N are what I would choose in regards to price/performance knowing first had what I know now. Keep in mind fit, feel, sound quality are subjective. For me the distinguishing factor for the XM3 is the noise cancelling and if that is important for your needs, then the decision is clear. For anyone else looking for adequate noise cancelling and wants to save $150 or more, go with a manufacturer refurb or even a new set of H900N's. The H910N's should be at US retailers shorty and may be an option too, but I have not used though.\n"}
{"text": "i would avoid seller shop smartdeals at all costs there was dirt and dust in the box it was sealed there was chinese lettering on the headphones no numbers for a serial number when it connected to the app it was different at the very top then the united states pair if you have enough money get the united states pair your missing out on alexa and google assitant thars not loaded in.\n"}
{"text": "After 1 month of use, CRACKLING NOISES started from my RIGHT earcup, only when the Noise Cancelling feature is turned on. Lo and behold, that's coincided with the end of my return period!! Apparently, it is a COMMON DEFECT, with many complaints on Sony's community website. There are even several YouTube videos on it. There is a suggestion that it can be fixed by the good old violent slap on the earcup, but I dare not try that method. Anyways, do NOT buy from an Amazon Re-selller as exchange/warranty is a REAL PROBLEM.\n"}
{"text": "These headphones far surpassed my expectations. I have the Sennheiser PXC 550's and the audio quality on the Sony's is spectacular. Great bass and noise cancellation is second to none. I love the noise isolation and the fact that they can focus on vocal ambient sounds, this really made me realize how noisy my environment really is. Only thing I don't like is how sometimes the app seems to forget the EQ settings or the noise cancellation settings. But I only fault the headphones for this at all. The comfort also has no comparison. Many times I forgot I was even wearing them; that's how light and comfortable they are. The only real con I can give these is how loose the adjustable headband is and I wish the cups had a more firm swivel. But even with those two purely subjective cons I stick by my 5 star rating. Pros: 1. Comfortable 2. Light 3. Sound quality is amazing, it's like I'm listening to my old songs for the first time. 4. I have an Android phone so the Google assistant integration is absolutely phenomenal (subjective) 5. These get loud, almost unreasonably loud and I love that. Cons: 1. I'm not fond of how loose the swivel of the cups is (subjective) 2. Adjustable headband feels a bit loose (subjective) 3. The touch controls are a bit hit or miss but I have not read the instructions so it may be an error on my part (purely subjective) Conclusion: These are a definite buy. Don't let my (what I consider subjective) cons sway you from purchasing these. These will definitely be packed in my book-bag as essentials along with my laptop and various chargers.\n"}

{"text": "I bought a Bose QC35ii and this Sony wh1000X3 model. Was trying to keep my price close to $300-$350. I wasnt interested in anything except killer audiophile HiFi sound quality first..  perhaps comfort a close second. The Bose were the most comfortable by a smidge but it might be because they were lighter in weight. The Bose noise cancel feature messed with my inner ear and gave me a slight sick headache but the Sony did not make me feel sick or effect me. Ive had problems with sea sickness since a carnival ride at age 13, long story.. but my wife doesnt have any issues and she said the Bose made her feel a little sick disoriented? It seemed the Bose Noise cancel worked better than the Sony but honestly I wanted to keep NC off Or very low on both headphones but couldnt do that with the Bose because the sound would loose bass and the mids would sound terrible. So. It came down to sound quality and how much I enjoyed the music and the Sony was hands-down amazing over Bose using Apple I-tunes app. BUT! Using the 360 app setting and listening to the newly found Tidal music app suggested on the Sonys is THE most enjoyable and hi-fi musical experience Ive ever had with ANY other system besides my very expensive vinyl record record player and B&W man cave system! That is.. until I played that premium TIDAL app through my living room Klipsch 7.2 sound system and also in my 2016 GX460 Mark Levinson car system!! Even before using that newly found music app the Sonys sounded much better than the Bose.. by a country ass mile. Bose would not quite get loud enough to enjoy at high-volumes but the Sonys are perfectly adequate at max or just before. 6 band EQ is perfect on the Sony app. Bose app was bare bones and kinda sucked. I have been a professional musician and with over 30 years and $100K plus of music gear Ive spent a lot of time listening and think Ive got great taste but even if youre an average Joe... the Sony is the better choice. I want to try the Beyerdynamic Amirons and the B&Os but thats $400-$500 range and those will have to wait till perhaps my son takes my Sonys. He got my in ear Beat Pros but hes gonna need to get pretty diplomatic to talk me out of my Sonys. \n"}
{"text": "I'm a bit of a collector of Audio Equipment and have 3 other, High End Headphones.  My experience with closed headphones has never been very good so I expected poor performance.  I was wrong. These headphones are accurate and the noise cancellation is as good as any other.  I highly recommend.\n"}
{"text": "I just bought it for a month and used less than 10 hours. The right speaker became to make some odd noise when the noise-cancel model was on.\n"}
{"text": "PROS: These headphones were a great purchase. If you like quality and want peace and quiet from public areas like planes, trains, subways, car rides, etc, these are the phones for you. My friends have enjoyed listening to these headphones too, you listen to sound the way the ear intended, by using your full outer gear to capture the sound vs having music blasted directly in your ear canal with traditional headphones, like the Apple AirPods. These were well worth the investment. CONS: every product can be improved upon, and these are no exception. The headphones are equipped with touch sensors on the putter side of the headphones, but are unmarked, you kind of have to memorize the controls from the introduction pamphlets. To me, this is inefficient, as humans have poor memories of where things are (working memory). These types of memories last only a few seconds, so youre going to forget numerous times how to lower the volume with using your fingers. Eventually youll figure out the easiest way to do this is to simply turn the volume down from your phone or Bluetooth device instead of the headphone. To me this is inefficient. Most manufacturers realize this and include buttons for things, to eliminate the need to use working memory. I do wish there were physical sound buttons on the headphones. SUMMARY: Other than that, the product is flawless, and the battery life really does last 30 hours, needing only an hour total to charge. Its amazing when you first start using it. I highly recommend using this product, 9/10 its the best headphones Ive ever purchased.\n"}
{"text": "After 3 weeks of use, a stupid hissing sound started from in the right earcup when noise canceling is on. I tried contacting the reseller and no response. After it started, I looked online and there are so many complaints about it. Lesson learned... don't buy from a reseller.\n"}
{"text": "I received the Chinese version instead of the international version. After 2 hours of scouring the trying to figure out how to change the language from Mandarin to English I did not find any thing about it. I finally gave in and looked through the app and found the English language driver. At the very least it was brand new head phones, but was not what the seller advertised. By the way the Chinese version does not have Google assistant or Amazon Alexa. So in the end of the day, the Sony headphones are one of best headphone I have ever owned. I would have given more stars if i had received the international version instead of the Chinese version.\n"}
{"text": "I bought these in anticipation of a 10-hour Dreamliner flight... They worked like a charm -- I had no problems hooking up to the video screen thru the included accessory cable and, for once, was able to watch movies at the *lowest* volume setting. The on-demand calibration feature seems to adapt well to various environments. On the plane, the engine noise was reduced considerably, and the crying kid two rows up was audible, but muted to the point of no concern. These headphones are very comfortable even though I wear them over my glasses.  A bit warm after a few hours, but this can be alleviated by taking them off for a few minutes. They emit the slightest hiss when in noise cancelling mode, but I do not notice it when listening to music. Also very effective in eliminating the hum of an office building (A/C noise and such).  I now wear them at work most of the time. Oh, the Bluetooth connection to my Nokia phone is great and the battery life is fantastic as well (down to 75% full after 10 hour on the plane).  The feature of announcing the battery level is very handy.\n"}
{"text": "While these headphones are slick and sound quite good, you should be aware of two problems; pairing with a Mac and they're very difficult to use in the cold. Mac issue: they will not pair with new versions of OS X and Sony knows it, people are screaming about totally losing connectivity after updates. Sony will not address the issue in any way. Seller will not take it as a return. Cold issue: virtual \"trackpad\" style gesture navigation of functions does not work in the cold.\n"}
{"text": "As a pair of headphones they are excellent I use them for everything. Comfortable while wearing but can get a little heavy on the ears when not adjusted right. I also like the battery life on these headphones and the feature of pressing once on power button to be told the battery percent. Even though they have long battery life they charge quickly. The only drawback on these is that I bought them for the noise cancellation feature since I live in a loud neighborhood which does work and there's a notable difference when noise cancelling is on vs when it is off. But the headphones don't cancel out anything is that is semi-loud/loud like my neighbors annoying music or the other neighbors crying baby when they are outside. But I imagine these weren't designed to take on my neighbors specifically, if you want these to work in an office or at home in a medium/quiet setting these are perfect. sometimes I miss calls because of these headphones. Personally, Id get the newer version (wh-1000xm4 or newer) if I ever was made to buy headphones again though.\n"}
{"text": "During flights these do an incredible job if reducing stress caused by noise. Amazing sound quality. Seemingly unending battery life and charges quicker than expected. Great carrying case. Just one thing... higher pitch sounds get through. I could slightly a hear shrieking person. These greatly reduced that sound, but not entirely. After one removes these after wearing them for any amount of time, the ambient noise is almost shocking. And I immediately retreat back to the headphones.\n"}
{"text": "I didn't really wanna spend 350 dollars on the new versions of these so I looked at these one and bought them for 190 used witch is a pretty good deal for a type of headphones like these the only complaint I have about these are the fact that when you download the app for these the adaptive sound feature is anooying when you are walking around/trying to do things cause it's constently beeping telling you it's \"adapting to the sound\" so I wouldn't recommend using the app cause it's not that useful and trys to make you download weird apps to use the 360 sound feature but besides that the noise cancelation feature witch you don't need the app for works really well and the battery life/sound quality are pretty good\n"}
{"text": "I work in a congested office with lots of noise.  Thankfully these headphones do a pretty good job of muffling voices.  When I put them on I am still amazed at how quiet they are.  While noise cancellation is great, I would still suggest finding some kind of music to mask over conversations.\n"}
{"text": "So the headphones we're amazing for like 3 weeks then I noticed when the NC was on there was like a wave sound in the right ear cup even when I played music so I decided to return and do a replacement since I feel like it's a one off thing Basically if you want something that beats Bose out of the water gets these but just be ready to return if you get a bad one (don't worry the Amazon usuall one month is still applicable on these which for me was a week away from ending so thankfully I did that)\n"}
{"text": "I dont have anything to compare the noise cancelling feature to. I have an issue with that one ear that I need to stop background noise.  These really help when someone in the house is watching TV with lots of noises like sports, especially football with the crowd noise. Ive used them in a movie theater to dampen the sound and that worked very well too. They dont block all noise but dampen it significantly and help with my sensitivity.\n"}
{"text": "I was on the fence to buy this headphones because in my new job I was going to be traveling a lot but I was undecided because the price for such a quality headphones was too good to ignore and I was like fine, let's do it. If anyone is undecided because of the International version, trust me, this is the same exact product when it comes to user experience as the US version. I would recommend this to anyone.\n"}
{"text": "I liked the headphones in general--the battery usually lasts me for around a day or a day and a half (wish it lasted more, though, or turned off automatically when removing the headphones to conserve battery), and except for the defect I'm about to mention (which sort of ruins a lot), the sound quality is good in general, and the cancellation works pretty great in general, HOWEVER there is a defect with my headphones where the left one has VERY audible feedback in the noise cancelling or ambient sound control mode, which drives me absolutely nuts!! If it wasn't for that defect, I would be almost completely happy with the headphones. Besides that, though, the microphone quality is very bad, so I always have to take my headphones off and disconnect them every single time I have to take or make a phone call. I would be cautious purchasing these headphones, since there's no warranty--if you get lucky, they won't be defective. I'm very disappointed that these headphones are defective.\n"}
{"text": "I purchased Bose at the same time to compare the two.  I couldn't tell the difference. Bose has a better interface and is narrower, in case you like to lay on your side with them. For the price BOTH of these should be made of a lightweight metal, not cheap plastic.\n"}
{"text": "I expected more with that price. Sound quality is ok. Not bad. But not as good as most reviews say. Noise cancelling works but it has this annoying ringing sound so i dont use it. But i can see my self using it in a plane. Would i recommend this? No, unless you have the money to throw away. It's Not for gaming incase you're wondering. specially on fps game. Theres a delay and it feels weird. Great for music up to 70% volume. Above that.. it starts to degrade.\n"}
{"text": "These headphones are incredible! I bought these before going on a long haul trip from USA to Australia. I charged them before I left and used them the ENTIRE flight (27 hours of travel each way). The noise cancelation was so good, I couldn't even tell I was on a plane. I couldn't hear the engines, or even the conversation of people sitting next to me. I used it for bluetooth music and hardwired with the handy airline adapter to watch in flight movies. I even used the active noise cancelation with no audio to sleep on the plane! It was better than the ear plugs I packed. After all that, when I returned to the US the batteries still had 90% remaining! That is absolutely amazing because I only charged it once before I left. Now I use them for work and I am still on the first charge. I love the adaptive awareness feature that allows me to adjust how much ambient noise I want to allow thru.\n"}
{"text": "In general, this is not a cheap product, But the manufacturer-provided super savings are here. After several months of daily use, I had mechanical noise and clicks, and it was horrible. I opened it and put some fat in the right places. That helped. Greedy - greedy guys from Sony, I wish you to hear the same noise in all your audio devices and everywhere use the 8-inch USB cable that you provide with these headphones.\n"}
{"text": "I absolutely love these headphones in most ways except that they have a very low maximum volume, which is super frustrating. I have to reset them several times a day to increase the maximum volume, which is time consuming and tedious. I wish there were a way to reset the volume without having to hold the two buttons for 10 seconds and reconnect to bluetooth. That is my only complaint, but it is a large one.\n"}
{"text": "So unfortunately disappointed. I was very excited to get these headphones after reading lots of positive reviews. When I received them, I felt like I had made a good decision. Initially the headphones sounded great. The noise canceling feature worked phenomenally. The comfort was great. All was well. Within a week of purchase my joy turned into agony. The right speaker developed a pressurized, rustling sensation. It made it painful to listen to anything while using the noise canceling feature, which was one of the main reasons I chose the headphones. Upon further research, I found this to be a known issue with many complaints. I have now returned the headphones and am apprehensive to try another pair. Huge letdown.\n"}
{"text": "These headphones are far better at sound quality and noise cancelling than the BOSE headphones the rest of the family has. If I were to have to find something they could improve on, they are probably a little less comfortable.  The ear cups get hot after wearing for a while.  It's totally worth the better sound though.  I feel the batteries may take a bit longer to charge, but they last a long time and they are prohibitively slow when charging.  I do wish they would charge and play music at the same time.  I've not needed them to, but I could imagine it being something that I could someday need/want.\n"}
{"text": "it never worked, it looks perfectly fine but it won't turn on, tried charging it still didn't work, tried using the cable, it doesn't even work while being wired. Based on the reviews i think the seller is selling refurbished ones. Some people are satisfied with it, me not so much cause it's defective. You might need to make a bet purchasing from this seller. Note: i never give anyone 1 star, but i felt scammed. so in your face ONE-STAR-SELLER !\n"}
{"text": "The noise cancellation is there. The sound quality is there. But man, the adaptive sound is so annoying. It changes if I go from walking to standing or sitting. Its very sensitive to movement. It doesnt do this subtly either; it loudly dings, cutting out your music, podcast, or phone call. It also cuts out my voice if Im speaking on a call. Why in the world cant the adaptive noise control just do all this passively without having to ding loudly in my ears and interrupt everything Im doing? These are too expensive to have such poor software design. What a bummer.\n"}
{"text": "I have Bose QC35 II's which I use outdoors for working with my John Deere diesel tractor, and also indoors.  I decided to by these Sony's so I could keep them with my tractor.  So after a few weeks using both, inside and out, this is my comparison.  Sound reduction seems the same.  The Boseshave far better battery life.  The Sonys are a pain to pair with my iphone and ipad, and need to be re-paired each time I try to use them. The Boses pair immediately by just flipping their swith on.  The Boses are way more comfortable on my ears; I can wear them all day.  The Sonys reach unbearable ear soreness after around 1 to 2 hours.  Bose vs Sony; I would take the Boses any day.\n"}
{"text": "This truly is the best of the line for noise-cancelling headphones. If you only need headphones for this feature alone and only going to be using wireless then they're awesome. I ran into several issues however that made them unusable at my current work set up even with other parts purchased to get them working. I also think there were a few missed opportunities with them as well and for a headset valued normally $300+ I would expect better Pros- -Noise Cancelling tech is actually insanely good, there's even an ambiance option that plays white noise with your audio to make it even more effective -Comfortable, I see a lot of reviews saying these are really uncomfortable to wear but compared to other headsets I've had over the years these are pretty comfy. -Wireless and good battery life -Multiple sound modes to mess with Cons -First of all, whoever is the physical engineer for these is an actual dunce. 1. I can't even plug any audio jack the headphones because the casing of the headphones comes too high 2 The audio slider isn't a slidder it's the side of the headphone and it's touch-sensitive, it's finicky/hard to work with/sometimes doesn't even work, and also isn't even shown visually. 3. No feature to my knowledge to stop it from auto turning off. One of the reasons I caved and got these is because my upstairs neighbour for some reason takes his loud ass dog for a walk at 4 am and I need to be up later in the day. I was going to wear these to sleep and keep the ambient sound on but they just turn off after about 5 mins of no input. 4. Can only take one input at a time, so I can actually \"plug\" in an audio jack cable however I have to hold it so it doesn't fall out. That's when I learned that I can't have both a Bluetooth and a wired input coming in at the same time. I've had cheap $20 headsets that can do this, so when I buy one worth more than 10x...well you see my point. I've had these for a little more than a week now and I already went back to the headset I had before them that I originally bought these headphones to replace. REALLY GOOD NOISE CANCELLING IT'S ACTUALLY UNREAL HOW GOOD IT IS and the sound quality is pretty great too. If you're going to be using these for a theatre set up where you're only focusing on one thing and that thing exclusively then these are for you. However, their low adaptability is why I'm most likely going to be returning them.\n"}
{"text": "I only gave this a 4 on sound quality because sometimes theres a light rustling noise in the right ear but its nothing that interrupts the music and you can only hear it with no music playing it rarely shows up. I am super particular on my technology, but it never bothers me at all. Sounds like a very very very distant thunder storm. The MX4 are coming out soon(November 2020) and they are a small upgrade but a bigger price tag. They headphones do warm your ears up if youre not use to it like me, but if youre busy doing something you dont notice and taking a little break with them off is more than enough for you to get back to work. If youre not used to noise cancellation you may experience some cranial pressure because it does need to shut out the air flow, nothing to be concerned about though. FANTASTIC HEADPHONES!!!\n"}
{"text": "awesome product, sound sometimes drop even when i'm close to the PC, but i guess that's the nature of Bluetooth headsets, material on other hand could be better noise cancelling doesn't eliminate office chatter, but significantly reduce the ambient noise my ears get heat sometimes, so, i have to re adjust them to let some air cool it down the black color looks awesome, and i love the overall design, great product\n"}
{"text": "I did a lot of research before I pulled the trigger on wireless headphones.  These worked great on the airplane.  I have a hard time hearing in loud ambient noise but was able to turn the ambient noise function on and I could hear the flight attendant very easily.  Not the best for phone calls because I try not to be loud when on my phone but I honestly didn't buy them for this feature.  Noise cancelling is great.  I was seated right next to the engine and with these I watched all of my movie with no issue.  Very comfortable and would highly recommend\n"}
{"text": "Just a heads up for anyone looking at these, they did not come with english as the initial language. The writing on the box was both English and Chinese and the language spoken by the headphones when turning them on/off/noice cancellation was Chinese. It's easy enough to change the language spoken in the headset to English through Sony's app, so that's no problem really. The issue though is that there is no support for virtual assistants that I have found. The option in the settings for these headphones seems to be a piece of Chinese software that I don't understand. Not a total deal breaker as the headphones still act like the WH1000-XM3s that we all know, but worth mentioning here. As for the features that are present, the sound quality is excellent, the noice cancellation is the best I've heard by far, and even though they aren't using the latest bluetooth standard, I've had few to no connection issues in my time with them. While plastic, the build quality seems robust and durable, and the charging speed is incredibly fast. The battery life is fantastic as well. I use these for work, school, gaming, movies, and music, and I only need to plug them in once every few days at most. These have support for Sony's 360 Reality Audio if you're subscribed to a streaming platform that offers those tracks, and while it isn't a necessity it is nice to have. For the price, I think the compromises made are more than acceptable given that the language is easily changed and I don't use virtual assistants on my phone/computer very much.\n"}
{"text": "I use it whenever my neighbor making noises, especially help prevent any noises when sleeping. only con when using it during sleeping is you cant change your position. hope Sony could have a noise cancelling headset only use for sleep.\n"}
{"text": "Waaaaaaaay better than BEATS solo. The over ear design is so much more comfortable, 3specially if you're wearing them for more than 45 minutes at a time. My ears ache after wearing the beats, these can be on for 8+ hours with no fatigue.\n"}
{"text": "After two months, developed a known hardware issue related to ANC, which other users have reported elsewhere (static/noise coming from one of the ears).  Cans were pretty good until then. I assumed that the seller would honor the 1 year (or whatever it is) warranty -- but no it turns out there's a 30 day return window and then you're out of luck.  So, sometimes it may be worth paying extra for a legit, warranteed  product.\n"}
{"text": "My ratings are based on the fact that the pkg. had been preopened. Charger was missing therefore I didn't get a chance to test it. So don't base the Sony product as a bad one, because it couldn't be checked out.\n"}
{"text": "Excellent noise cancellation and the app lets you fine tune it to the hilt! Sound quality is excellent as far as bass and miss high, very good value for the money!\n"}
{"text": "I just received these today and I was excited to try them as they were the first pair of noise cancelling headphones I've owned. That excitement turned into disappointment when I opened the box and only found the headphones and a wired connection cable. Although I have a charging cable that is compatible with the headphones and the headphones itself are amazing, not coming with the charging cable and adapter as advertised is disappointing especially when I paid so much for them. Just be aware that although the headphones are amazing, it might not with everything in the box.\n"}
{"text": "Better than expected noise reduction - great price.  Matched up with Bose specs for $100 less retail so we were glad we got the Sony (my son and I each got the headphones.  He was equally impressed)\n"}
{"text": "XM3 is older than the XM4 but functions a lot better than it's younger sibling. So glad I was able to find a pair as the word is out that these are the best wireless NC headphones on the market!\n"}
{"text": "Youre purchasing the Japan version of these headphones, the product inside is the same and syncs up with the Sony app just fine, youll likely need to change the language to English once installed, other than that no notable issues - well worth the price in my opinion!\n"}
{"text": "Este producto est catalogado como de los mejores si no el mejor de la alta gama, y de hecho lo he disfrutado mucho, sin embargo, la cancelacin de ruido no es lo que esperaba. Se supone que cancela el ruido en su totalidad, pero NO, o al menos no ha sido mi experiencia. La cancelacin del ruido no es total, quizs s en el ambiente, pero no para sonidos muy cerca como voces, telfono, tv, etc. Si hay alguien que le pasa lo mismo, espero compartan la experiencia y buscar alguna solucin.\n"}
{"text": "I have been using great sennheiser open 598 se, but the experience gets worse when your your are in noisy environment, and your headphone sound leak can disturb other , and it needed an amplifier for bass enhancement. But it is very comfortable and sound is quite natural. Then I decided to buy sony wx 1000 m3 over Bose quite comfort after lots of reviews and comments. Oh god, this is a different wireless noise cancelling league headphone. Everything is good and bass is like having an impulse of life while listening to the music. Sennheiser 598 is the most natural sound emitting headphone, but this sony headphone is doing the same ( some frequency is less enhanced but overall a great separation of frequencies at different sound intensity). The kind of music I listen to ( from indian to western to latin american)..this Sony WX is just making sound stage alive on daily to daily life. And noise cancellation is outstanding, not just for music, my housemates are too loud, even then it saves me from the disturbance. I have a slight tinnitus to some frequency, and this headphone does not feel me I have that for 95% of time. Gift yourself this one, always there is new music, in case of car and bike, the road and rule are the same.\n"}
{"text": "Easy to use with Apple products. With Windows machines, it was a bit complicated as I would have to manually change the sound settings to output stereo or function as a headset depending on the app I was using. It took me a while to figure out why there was no sound playing when I watched YouTube... There was one mishap I had though on my Macbook Pro. Occasionally, the sound in one ear turns off, and at first, I thought my headphones broke. Turns out the MacOS setting was set to the balance being all on one ear. Not sure if that's a Sony issue or MacOS issue. Love the noise cancellation, sound quality, and battery life though! Not sure about the microphone though. I haven't got a chance to listen to my own recording with it. It doesn't seem like it was impressively better than my old HP Pavilion x360 laptop's mic though.\n"}
{"text": "Boy if its not a deal of the year then I dont know what is. I tried Suface headphones 2 for $250 just because I didnt want to spend $350 for this Sony headphone. Oh well my friend sends me a link for this international version which is 100$ off. And boy do I enjoy this headphones. Windows Surface headphones su@k a$$ compared to Sony. Excellent noise canceling. But the microphone is not the best. I drive a truck and when just listening to music it cancels about 90% of noise which is greaaaaaat considering Im driving a big rig. But when it comes to phone calls, microphone tries to cancel out the noise and I guess it needs some improvements. Well if youre in the street or somewhere that is not as noisy its great. So people of you have $250 to spend DO NOT BUY ANYTHING OTHER THAN THIS PRODUCT!!! I dont usually leave feedback but I couldnt not leaving one for this purchase!\n"}
{"text": "Sound quality is excellent. Very clear, ear tickle-y high notes, good bass. Comfortable for wearing for a long time (though your ears may get a bit toasty). Ear pads seem to be a high quality, thick material that isn't likely to peel. Carrying case is really sturdy. My only beef is that the \"silver\" is actually beige. Like, furniture you'd find in an architecture firm in the early 90's beige. I like to think of it as theft deterrent. Though if you're concerned about looks, go with the black version. The black version will also hide the ear grease on the inner pads. If you can't see it, it doesn't exist, right? As for the noise cancelling, they don't block out EVERYTHING, but in my experience in an open office, conversations sound like they're in another room instead of right behind you. I don't want to hear about all of your buddies in high places, Ken. Keyboards, clicking noises and other background noises, however, are completely cancelled. The cup your ear to hear outside noise feature isn't that great, so I don't use it. But I do use the other touch controls (volume, skip track, pause/play). Battery life is good, though it takes a long time to charge. I use them for 8 or so hours a day and only have to charge them every couple of days.\n"}
{"text": "The sound was great on these headphones, until they stopped working.  After less than three months, and while listening to them, the Sound would cut out and the Bluetooth connection would be lost.  I tried dozens of times to reestablish the Bluetooth connection without success.  I finally called Sony and sent them all the relevant invoices and Amazon Prime order for warranty and technical support.  Sony acknowledges that the headphones are defective but demanded I go through the Amazon retailer, DD US, for a refund or warranty claim.  I emailed DD US through Amazon and have not heard back at all.  So basically, I have lost $244.00 and cant find anyone at Amazon or DD US to entertain my complaint. SHAME ON SONY!  BUY BOSE!  I AM SO DISAPPOINTED AND WILL NOT BUY SONY EVER AGAIN.  Im also disappointed with Amazon.\n"}
{"text": "Was really excited when the price came down on these Sonys as I'd heard a lot of great things about them. Ultimately, I was pretty disappointed and I returned them in exchange for the comparable Bose model (which was less expensive when on sale). Issues I encountered with the Sonys:  By far the biggest problem was the random crackling-popping-thumping sounds that would happen during quiet parts in music or when I was wearing the Sonys with only the NC activated. I looked up this problem online and saw many other people have had this issue even after updating the firmware. I found it intolerable --even painful-- to the point where I was avoiding using them. If it weren't for this awful noise, I'd probably have kept the headphones.  No matter how I adjusted them, these headphones are uncomfortable after an hour or so. I'm a 6-ft tall man with an average-size head (I guess). Made my ears hurt around where the headphone 'cups' create a seal. I really needed headphones I could wear for several hours at a time. These were not up to the task.  Can't connect to more than one device! This is mind-boggling to me as I would imagine many people would need to easily switch back and forth between a computer and a phone. To do this with the Sonys is such a chore.  I do not like the touch-based controls. They are very easy to trigger accidentally or trigger the wrong function. I much prefer physical buttons.  Small gripe: after comparing the Sonys to other brands, it seems the Sony Noise-Cancelling feature relies considerably more on white noise to mask outside sounds. The white noise is audible during quiet passages in music and quieter moments of dialogue. Not a deal-breaker, but it was something I did not miss after I switched over to a different brand of headphones.  USB-C cable is annoying and unnecessary when a much more common connection would be just as good. The included cable is comedically short. Why bother at all? Some things I like about the Sonys: They look cool. The bluetooth connection is very robust. The noise-cancelling is excellent (except for the noise issues mentioned above).\n"}
{"text": "Im enjoying the headphones. I guess my only gripe is how much it drains your iPhone battery. Id think the headphone battery would be the problem. But just using the headset 1 hour at my gym really drains my phone to 0% after a days general use of my iPhone with everyday usage. I guess as long as you have a place to plug your smartphone into power, youll truly get 30 hours from these Sony headphones. If not, you can do the math. \n"}
{"text": "I've had these cans for a little over a month. I've been on the fence about a review because even though I absolutely love the sound I'm getting from these headphones, there is a nagging concern I have in 2 areas 1. When i listen to certain songs, especially at a higher volume, I begin hearing a pop in the left ear. I've seen this crop up from time to time in other reviews and it's very disconcerting. It doesn't happen EVERY time, but it's definitely there and definitely annoying. 2. There is an echo when talking to someone via the headphones. I've tried it on a few different occasions and the listener on the other end always complains that they can't hear me well due to the echo. I participate in online course and want to use these to listen to and participate in lectures, but I can't due to the echo issue. I can't recommend these until and unless there is a fix available for those concerns\n"}
{"text": "Okay Im no audio file I Id be lying if I said I dont like a good listening experience. These do a great job at doing so. Seriously they really do. I originally bought these headphones after extensive YouTube reviews and just about every comparison under the sun. That coupled with the fact that I was going on a trip out of the country in the summer of 2019 made pulling the trigger on these headphones simple. I wasnt going to be dealing with crying babies on a 9+ hour flight. These things were a champ at handling plane noise as I would expect and made watching videos and listening to music honestly a joy. After about 4-5 months of owner ship I started to notice a very glaring issue. That bass that these things are capable of producing is amazing. A little too amazing. Ill be honest I listen to a lot of industrial dance music and other similar genres that emphasize the low driving bass note. I should also probably say that I am an avid user of Spotifys in-app EQ to help really take advantage of what is capable.... After only 4-5 months I noticed a slight rattle in the left ear. Keep in mind I never had these things at 100%, in fact Id say I didnt go above 70-80 if that. Another month passed and then the right speaker I believe is On its way out. Sucks cuz I used these for every day use. Ultimately I dropped these because I ended up getting a fire deal (sub 200) on some AirPod pros that I couldnt turn down. The only reason Im making this review is because I managed to get and ear infection and noticed all of these issues that made me put this amazing head set down. Guess Ill have to find out what dealing with the international warranty is like during covid.....\n"}
{"text": "Pros: -Noise Cancelling: I bought these as a pair of quarantine headphones and they are absolutely wonderful. They perfectly drown out noisy NYC neighbors + people on the street! -Build Quality: No complaints here. Lightweight yet feels very durable. Neutrals: -Touch Controls: I know some people don't like them but they seem to work fine for me. I don't really wear these while wearing gloves so I can't speak to that. -Sound Quality: They're pretty good for noise-canceling headphones, but generally are a bit too bassy and closed off for me. Again, not a ding, you can't compare these to open-back headphones for sound stage. Cons: The Microphones: So far nobody has complained about hearing me clearly, so that's not an issue for me. What's weird is that sometimes I can hear myself talk on a split second delay...and sometimes I can't. I actually prefer to hear myself as these block so much noise I often find myself talking a bit too loudly into the mics. However so far I have not really found a pattern to when it decides to pass through my own voice.\n"}
{"text": "Bought these to replace a ten year old pair of Bose cans. Wow. Next level noise canceling that exceeded by expectations. The range of Frequencies and decibles it can quiet down is incredible. Almost too quiet! But you can adjust the level of cancellation in the app if its too much. Great sound for Bluetooth - rich and full spectrum. Would say the sound stage is not quite as vast as open ear but everything has compromises. Otherwise they sync well and quickly, battery life is tremendous, and can use if battery is dead with 3.5mm cable. Its everything you want and more. You will not be disappointed with these.\n"}
{"text": "Woot is an Amazon-owned store masquerading as it's own thing.  Beware their \"warranty\".  Purchased these headphones in December.  Sony headphones, which usually come with a one year warranty.  Except that Woot only offers an \"international warranty\" of 90 days.  You can guess the rest.  on the 100th day they stopped working...after only light use at that.  Sony says talk to Woot.  Woot says, so sorry, we can't help you.  Amazon's true colors shining through.  Buyer beware I guess.\n"}
{"text": "The sound quality and bass are really great. The anc is really great. At times when people around you are speaking and you have the anc on, i find that the best way to cancel noise in those environments is to play audio to drown out the sound of voices. They are really comfortable with a memory foam like pad. You dont even relly notice them, but if sony is listening to me, i thing that there should be a cooling mechanism in these because my ears start to get hot sometimes after wearing them for a couple hours. These are a really great pair of anc headphones that are all you really want/need\n"}
{"text": "I was recommended these headphones by a friend who is into tech. I spent around 2-3 weeks looking up reviews, weighing my options, and debating between these and the XM4's. I went with the XM3's due to my budget, and so far, they work pretty well. The audio is great, the audio features on the app are really cool (between arena, concert hall, outdoors, and club--I really like the changes in sound quality, which enhances my music experience). The mic isn't the best, and sometimes it gets hard to communicate on the phone. Otherwise, this is a solid product. Would definitely recommend for someone who is not an audiophile but also wants a decent set of headphones.\n"}
{"text": "While these are easily the most comfortable, best quality headphones I've ever owned, I heavily regret buying from this seller. Within 10 months, the 3.5mm jack on my pair crapped out, forcing me to only have the option to use bluetooth. This product isn't eligible for Sony's one-year warranty, and product support only lasts with this seller for six months, which means I'm out of luck. Not worth buying from this seller just to save a little bit of money.\n"}
{"text": "Someone recommended this set to me and I jumped on it. The sound is great. The equalizer and ambient sound controls that come with the app provide a lot of options. However, the noise cancelling wasn't as good as I hoped. It blocks out most sounds, including the ventilation. It doesn't always block out voices though. I bought these to block out a co-worker but I could still hear her shrill, high pitched voice from across the room and through a door. They are pretty good but they aren't magic.\n"}
{"text": "After using these for couple of months I have came to conclusion that they are not quite comfortable. And sound quality is not better than my Audio Technica m40x. I can't wear them for more than an hour, my ears start sweating and hurting. The fact that you cannot connect them to several devices at the same time is a bummer. And that could be fixed via a software update, just like on the latest version of this headphone. But greedy Sony won't push that update so that you buy the new headphones.\n"}
{"text": "Slightly (very slightly) better noise cancellation than the Bose QC35 v1 that I have, but less comfortable -- the headband is tighter and the padding on the earcups is not good, so my ears and head end up hurting after an hour.  Both the WH-1000XM3 and the Bose QC35 v1 are great at blocking constant droning/thrumming sounds but neither is good at blocking out voices.\n"}
{"text": "I had a pair of the original Bose Quiet Comfort headphones.  They have served very well for many years. Recently I was noticing that volume was reduced playing content via my smartphone, so it was time to look for a new pair. I'm brand loyal so the Bose 35 was the default choice.  However I noticed that the Sony WH1000XM3 was available for $278 on Amazon.  This particular headphone is silver (which was my preference) and is the \"International\" model.  As far as I can tell, this model is exactly like the \"American\" model, but the packaging is more multi-lingual than normal.  The headphones are outstanding.  The sound quality is superb and the noise canceling is very good.  I typically use these on airplanes in the wired connection mode so I can't comment on Bluetooth performance, but in wired mode they deliver terrific, full range sound against a very quiet background.  The only noise present is something similar to a slight wind noise, but hardly noticeable given the quality of the sound from the audio source. The one time I did need to use the Bluetooth connection was to do a business call from an airport so I used the headphones to make the call.  I was highly suspicious of background noise being picked up by the microphone, but my listeners said the audio on their end came through very well.  The audio on my end, needless to say, was outstanding. Generally, the comfort is quite good.  These are heavier than my original Quiet Comfort, but not fatiguingly so.  Also, the ear pieces completely surround my ears quite well and the material used for the ear pieces and headband is almost luxurious.  So, bottom line, for approximately $100 less than what the \"American\" market headphones were priced at, this was an outstanding value and I would recommend these headphones to anyone considering a high end pair, particularly for use in a higher noise environment, like plane flights.\n"}
{"text": "What I like: - sound quality when listening to music What I dislike: - audio in phone calls sucks - headphones pick up a lot of background noise - inconsistent noise sometimes heard in the left ear; firmware update didn't help Overall, great product with big shortcomings. I've had the earlier version and now this one - I don't understand why Sony didn't fix the audio. Sony forces us to have the second pair of headphones only to talk on the phone - this sucks and that is why I'm giving it only 3 stars.\n"}
{"text": "Pros: - Great sound quality. - Multiple levels of adjustment for the noise cancelation. - Comfortable headband and ear cups could spend hours listening to music without getting tired. - Battery life is excellent. Cons: - Integration with multiple devices is not there, you need to manually disconnect and reconnect if you want to change devices. - Integration with the iPhone is not as seamless as it is with AirPods (As expected) - Make me sweat a lot and need to wipe earpieces after every use.\n"}
{"text": "Best value noise cancelling headphones, almost the same quality as my Bose QC35. But when they drop their prices like this, they absolute beat Bose. Light weight and good touch controls. I would recommend this for the comfort, price and quality.\n"}
{"text": "I primarily use my headphones for music and I intended on using them for calls, occasionally. If you're just using to listen they're perfect- couldn't have asked for better sound quality. Call-wise, I've been told I sound further than usual (I typically use airpods)- that's not a huge deal breaker for me since I didn't intend on using them for calls very often. Noise cancellation is fantastic, almost a little eerie.\n"}
{"text": "If you're an audiophile, these may not be for you. If you need the best noise cancelling quality, these are it. If you manipulate the equalizer you can make the sound slightly better but not as great as some others of the same price point. I'm impressed with the noise cancelling and that was the main reason for my purchase. Would definitely recommend!\n"}
{"text": "One of the best pieces of tech Ive purchased in years. When I put them on I was amazed by the quality. I ended up spending 3+ hours in one sitting just listening to music. I was so impressed by the quality that I ended up getting another pair for my wife. As a longtime owner of Bose QuietComfort, I thought nothing could top them at a similar price point. This Sony set is even better.\n"}
{"text": "Overall a 5. Sound quality is excellent as is noise canceling. Very lightweight,  which may also make them feel a little flimsy. Controls are built into headset, so not intuitive so read instructions.  Definitely worth the extra money over almost as good competition.\n"}
{"text": "They are doing concrete restoration in my Florida condo, and I was amazed how well they work. They cut out the jackhammering much, much better than I ever expected. I've fallen asleep watching TV with them on, while the workers are hammering away!\n"}
{"text": "Amazing. Just amazing. Hearing songs in this quality for someone whos only ever had the apple wired earbuds is chilling and beautiful. The noise cancelling is great. The build quality is very nice and the design looks great. The app has so many personalization features. Would 100 percent recommend.\n"}
{"text": "I want to leave a better review for these because they work great, but the head band part of these headphones hurts. Even just after 30 minutes of wear these will give me the biggest headache and make the top of my head sore. Pretty sad about these.\n"}
{"text": "The Sony WH-1000M3 have excellent sound quality and amazing noise cancellation technology built in. They are super convenient for travelers and frequent flyers. In my experience they cancel out perfectly a engine noise like an airplane's or a car's engine, they are comfortable and have excellent battery life 20 to 22 hrs. Paring together sound quality, noise cancellation, comfort and battery life, this headphones are in my opinion the best of 2019.\n"}
{"text": "Its comfortable, sounds great, cancels ambient sounds well Im very happy with the purchase. For my head it fits without a clamping feeling. The only con is that I often have to use the app to change device. It doesnt automatically switch from iPhone to iPad. But I live with it.\n"}
{"text": "As an audiophile, I highly recommend these. These headphones give attention to all ranges of sound, from highs to low bass. The sound is incredible and very spacious. Also ideal for video games in my experience, makes it sound like you're really there.\n"}
{"text": "The headphones cancel noise fine. They aren't some sort of miracle device though. If someone is talking next to you, you'll hear it. Also, as some reviews said, it's a little bit uncomfortable if you wear it for a long time. This is my first noise-canceling headphone, so I can't say much about how good it is compared to other headphones, but I'm satisfied with it.\n"}
{"text": "I looked at several reviews before purchasing this product. I was surprised by how great the sound quality is. The noise canceling works great, but the sound quality is the best feature on these headphones. I use them at work to drown out annoying coworkers.\n"}
{"text": "Ok I've had this only 1 day & so far I'm in love. It truly blocks out all the extra noise making studying in a house with children & teens possible. I can hear breath sounds & heart rhythms great! Now I've only had it one day, I want to have gotten some serious use out of it before I can really know how well it works.\n"}
{"text": "The reason I am returning these headphones is because while wearing, they uncomfortably apply a slight pressure to the sensitive area behind the ear lobe. The slight pain was immediately noticeable when I put them on. I gave them a fair shot and attempted to wear them longer to break them in however the pain became too bothersome. Unfortunately these headphones are not for me.\n"}
{"text": "These are hands down the best noise cancelling headphones I've had. Battery life is ~40hrs, I use these all day for work and charge them once a wee. One of the best features is that they get like 70+% charge after about 10mins of charging.\n"}
{"text": "Works fine with Windows 10. no problems at all. However is not working via Bluetooth on MacBook Air. It is not visible so I cannot pair it. Unfortunately when I have realized it, this headset was not qualified for a return. Contacted live chat with Sony and was able to resolve problem in a few minutes.\n"}
{"text": "I love the sound love the quality noise canceling is excellent but it ok when doing phone calls but other than that its worth every penny!get them!!\n"}
{"text": "Boomy & muddy. If you want to get decent sound quality, you will have to use EQ ALWAYS. If you want to use EQ and keep high-quality codec (not SBC), you will have to use EQ NOT from Sony app (as it resets any codec to SBC once you use EQ). Noice cancellation is great, but it doesn't make any sense to me with such awful sound quality and codecs/EQ approach. And yes, Bose QC beats Sony by comfort definitely.\n"}
{"text": "These headphones are amazing! Theres an app that lets you manage the sound settings and ambient noise vs cancelling. This has transformed my commute and cube life at work. Totally worth the money! I couldnt be happier!\n"}
{"text": "Sony as always has meet a music perfection with these headphones. The equalizer comes with this headphone works so well on iPhone and uplift the music and adjust the bass so nicely, you won't have to care about volume, like it adjust itself if sound is getting to noisy or bass is getting distorted. And you can compare with stereo systems it sound so well. And battery, I charge it once or twice a month :)\n"}
{"text": "Only negative issue concerning  these headphones is there ability to only link to one device by Bluetooth at one time.  Overall is a great product.\n"}
{"text": "I personally use these while at work, & boy do these put me in my own little world! The noise cancelation is amazing! The sound quality is just as great. Absolutely no complaints here (well maybe the headphone hair after using them for 8 hrs a day, but nothing a little water cant fix).\n"}
{"text": "Absolutely the best Noise Cancelling headphones right now on the market. I love Bose Headphones as well but Sony has a much more comfortable feel. Also, Sony has a slightly better sound quality, and wider variety of controls. The only reason to by Bose is if you're are going to wear headphones for jogging or working out, since they have a much tighter grip.\n"}
{"text": "Love them glad they dropped the price on them when I bought them great sound quality and anc dont cheat your selves treat your selves. You can also customize the sound setting of the headphones to your liking. Might just buy another pair in black \n"}
{"text": "Out of the box these sound good, but after 10 hours of use, they sounded excellent. Music felt more lively and had more life. Good battery life and excellent noise cancellation too. Worth buy.\n"}
{"text": "They are the best. I bought the bose q35 and senhiessers. Best sound and comfort. Longest battery. Best tech. Amazing noise canceling.\n"}
{"text": "My new favorite listening device. Good all around sound. Customizable EQ and sound. Amazing noise canceling. Sit next to a fan and that sound will disappear after hearing the noise canceling on announcement. Sony has raised the bar with these?\n"}
{"text": "Excellent sound, excellent battery life and the active noise cancelation is amazing. Light weight, comfortable, build quality is top notch. Wife loves them!\n"}
{"text": "I bought these headphones at BestBuy for $300 before they were stolen, so I was hoping these ones on Amazon would be the same quality. It truly is the best headphones around, especially since I bought these for $250 at the time Im writing this review. I did notice that the ambiance mode does seem to be a bit quieter, but its not like its blasting the sound (could be a recent update of software). Very comfortable on your ears and very long lasting! I would recommend this to anyone whos interested in noise canceling headphones. THESE ARE BETTER THAN AIRPOD PROS!\n"}
{"text": "Bought this pair and the cheaper ones everybody had on sale this year for $80+. These blew those away, bigtime. The others are going back. These were in new condition, no different from US version and well worth the price.\n"}
{"text": "These things are decently comfortable and have decent audio and sound isolation. The software is absolutely horrible however. The controls on the headphones are completely useless, I have yet to get any of the swiping gestures to work as intended. Also you cannot connect to multiple bluetooth devices, you have to manually disconnect and reconnect every single time. Now if these headphones were sub 200 dollars I would give 5 stars. These ridiculous design flaws on a 250-350 dollar pair of headphones is unacceptable.\n"}
{"text": "I bought the international version, so when I went to set them up I believe they were speaking Mandarin. You can easily change the langue with the app Sony suggest to download.\n"}
{"text": "Excellent all around, sound, comfort and noise cancelling. The phone calls with some noise was hard for people to hear me. Poor microphone for phone calls, abd and people say voice goes in and out.\n"}
{"text": "The product in it of its self is fantastic, the headphones are so fun, I love the sound. However mine came with an odd defect, the right ear occasionally starts making the sound you might hear when you have water in your ear. I'm not sure were it comes from, but it is frustrating to hear, if I cycle through the noise canceling options it stops. It's annoying due to the price I paid for them that I have to deal with that\n"}
{"text": "This product has poor wireless communication with the phone. The signal is always cut, every 30 sec.  Battery dies so quick. You have to charge frequently. It hurts my ears  a lot, not a very ergonomic item. I can not wear it longer than 15-20 min, after that time, I feel so much pain on my ears. Why I got so late to write a review on this item after purchasing was,I started using it lately.And I am so regretful for purchasing it.The money is not worth!!!!!!!\n"}
{"text": "My boyfriend cannot hear me at all. Im going to say that these work great! He can play his video games and I can watch TV!\n"}
{"text": "The battery was dead on arrival -- not able to be charged. They're beautiful headphones and I was very eager to try them, but I had to send them back. Very disappointing.\n"}
{"text": "Worth every penny. Incredible sound. Extremely comfortable on my head. Awesome long battery life. Great app with seriously cool adjustments and features. I'm so glad I bought these and not a $50 set of headphones that I would have regretted.\n"}

{"text": "I fly a lot for work, and I finally broke down and decided to spend money on sound cancelling head phones. I had some older Bose that I was unsatisfied with. I read a lot of reviews and settled on the WH-1000XM3. I love them!! The fit is very nice, the sound quality for music is very nice. I am satisfed with the noise cancelling ability, and I appreciate the option to turn that off  with touch to hear airport announcements. The headphones do come with a very, very short charging cable so I did go online and buy a longer cable. The battery life really does last 30 hours. The headphones come with a nice carrying case. I do not use them for phone calls so I cannot give feedback on that.\n"}
{"text": "disclaimer: Im not a bot or paid fake reviewer. Bought this after doing online research about Sony vs Bose. Couldnt resist the $100 off or so price tag with the international designation. The only difference Ive experienced is having the default language set to Chinese. When you do updates to the headphones then it appears to revert back to Chinese but its easy to change to your preferred language via the app. Headphones themselves are great. Youll need to play around with cancellation/ambient settings to see what you like and prefer, but bottom line is they get the job done. I bought these to offset my riding mower when doing the lawn. Literally cant believe I didnt get these 4 years ago. Once the noise cancellation setting is engaged, I can barely hear my mower and can clearly hear music/podcasts without going deaf by having to crank up the volume. If you have the same issues, do yourself a favor and save your long term hearing by indulging yourself. I wish technology like this was around 20 years ago since Ive probably done enough damage to my ear drums. Granted its an expensive investment and Im as cheap of a guy as they come but I have zero buyers remorse. Side note: these arent compatible for workouts/exercise. Cushions around ear will get sweaty and fall off. Obviously theyre not designed for that so no big deal. Second side note: these are great for completely eliminating your family during quarantine When you have to get work done. Your kids can be screaming full octave 10 feet away and you wont hear them. Use at your discretion so your wife doesnt eventually bring the hammer down on you\n"}
{"text": "After trying several other cheaper alternatives, i bit the bullet and bought a pair of these.  The difference in noise cancelling and sound quality compared to other models is night and day and is fantastic for this type of product.  As for gaming, potential buyers should be aware that these are just stereo headphones, you're not going to get any fancy simulated surround sound or anything like that but the sound quality is excellent.  The integrated mic works well for video chats, Skype, you name it, and I've yet to have anyone complain about not being able to hear me which was not the case with several other models.  While i still think these are overpriced, they are very well done and are worthy of your hard earned $$ if you choose to buy one.\n"}
{"text": "I bought this headset because of Covid-19 lockdown - everyone must work from home. Only problem - listening to meetings is no fun with the heating coming on every now and then, others deciding that now's the time to use the vacuum cleaner, ... How good is the ANC ? I compared it next to a dust extractor and a table saw; conclusion: not as good as 3M Peltor earmuffs, but close. Audio is crystal clear, the headset is very comfortable even after longer use, and the battery seems to last a long time. It can be paired with multiple ( up to 8 according to instructions ) devices at once, so you only have to select the headphones on your laptop/chromebook/cellphone if they are not selected already and you are good to go. Sound is good even for non-ANC, and the built-in microphone that completes the 'headset' part works just fine; possibly the only weak point is that the microphone doesn't suppress ambient noise quite so well.\n"}
{"text": "Though this is labeled as the international version, everything in the box indicates this is the exact same model as the one sold in the US. It even came with the paperwork for the US and Canada warranty. The only reason it's marked international is probably because the seller bought them through different channels than the ones US retailers use, which meant it was sold ot them at a lower price for a different market, so the seller passed some savings on to the buyer. So the question is whether you're willing to give up an extra $100 just for a 1 year manufacturer warranty, I'm not (third party warranties cost less for longer terms, and some credit cards provide extended warranties to items you purchase with them). One thing that is sorely missed on these headphones is the ability to quick-switch between different devices. Since I have a laptop with bluetooth and a smartphone, it would be great to use the headphones with either of them without having re-pair them. Included in the box were a very short USB-C cable (only a few inches long, and with no wall adapter), plane-headphone jack adapter, headphone jack cable, carrying case, and instructional material. They're very comfy and I have no problem wearing them for long periods of time. I've never had good quality headphones before, and I enjoyed the sound from these from the moment I first had them play a song. I don't know if they're \"audiophile grade,\" but to my naive ears, they sound great. The noise cancelling and noise isolation are great. Just don't expect to block out the sound of people shouting. There is no dedicated virtual assistant button, but a long-press on the touch pad will activate it anyway if you don't want to re-map the NC/ambient aware button to the assistant, like me.\n"}
{"text": "I spent hours over the course of several days setting these up, and one of the software updates shut down the headphones for over 4 hours. They powered off after finishing the update and would not turn back on. Pairing is a nightmare. First the problem will be that your phone or computer won't find them. You'll have to reset your Bluetooth and the headphones a bunch of times before they are vissible. After they are finally visible, the head phones will show up and the computer will say they connected, but they will not be available as a sound output device... If you then turn on and off the headphones again, they may show up with a slightly different name and then will start to work if you repair with the \"new\" device... The most extreme problem is syncing with Macs. The headphones will not be visible when you turn them on even if you turn off bluetooth on all devices that have synced to the headphones before. To debug that, you are supposed to force the headphones into pairing mode by holding the power button for 7 seconds... But if the headphones are off when you hold for 7 seconds they just turn on and nothing happens and if they are on when you hold the power for 7 seconds they just turn off before entering pairing mode... I repeated the same process dozens and dozens of times with slight alterations before it worked, and I still have no idea why it worked. I feel crazy for trying the same thing so many times, and that's the issue: you could spend arbitrarily many hours following instructions perfectly and they may just happen to not work depending on your roll of the dice. There are numerous debugging guides online for these, but you will probably not find all the info you need in one place and I had to reference at least 3 different articles to get these working on all my devices because there would always be an issue that was not covered by whatever debugging guide I was reading. These are great once they start working, but you do have to think about them in terms of the value of your time... Is it worth 4 hours - 8 hours of set-up? That could easily be more money than you paid.\n"}
{"text": "I basically bought this product for the noise cancelling capabilities with the added bonus of having pretty good sound quality for the price. Approximately 1 week after I received the headphones I began to notice a persistent crackling sound coming from one of the speakers (think it was my left but sometimes it would happen in the right ear too). The sound it was making was, for me, very similar to that annoying sound you hear when it's really windy outside and the wind keeps disturbing the microphone. At first it was rare and manageable but then it started happening all the time and was getting progressively louder for some reason. It seems this is a defect with these headphones where this odd sound will play when using the headphones on the max noise cancelling level. With noise cancelling not working properly without driving me insane these headphones were a waste of time. If they had worked properly I think I would have greatly enjoyed them.\n"}
{"text": "USB-C charging capability, seamless Bluetooth connectivity with automatic reconnection at power-up, 30 hour battery life... Rich bass, clear mids, crisp highs, unparalleled vocal clarity, adjustable virtual soundstage, optional manual equalizer, superb active noise cancellation, excellent passive listening for environmental awareness during physical activities, simply wonderful listening experience! This model includes a case, an in-flight audio adapter, and a USB-C cable for charging and software updates.  Albeit lightweight and low profile, the headphones maintain a seemingly high-end feel despite a 95% plastic construction material.  There are only two tactile buttons on the left ear cup for power and Bluetooth operation.  Remote control operations are limited to gestures made onto the outer shell of the right cup with your finger(s).  That being said, changing volume and switching tracks is a bit of a PITA if you arent patient.  However, you can INSTANTLY lower the volume of your active media device to a whisper by completely covering the right ear cup with the palm of your right hand.  IMO, youre better off changing the volume or music track on your media device.  The remote control features are the only thing I dont like about these headphones.  Unfortunately, Sony has not made any additions to the WH-1000XM Series beyond the 3.  Additionally, owners of this model have confirmed that remote gestures are unresponsive in cooler climates. Beyond the remote control gestures, these wireless active noise canceling headphones are second to none, bringing life to any genre of music in the noisiest of environments and I would most definitely recommend these headphones to anyone looking for high resolution audio headphones with wireless and active noise cancellation features.  These Bluetooth headphones are simply the BEST.  Hands down. UPDATE @ 19NOV2019 After a few days of use, Ive mastered the gesture controls on the right ear cup.  Its not as challenging as I originally thought.  Its actually pretty genius and quite responsive once you become familiar with the command gestures.  If youre on the fence, you can climb down now...and buy these headphones!  You wont regret it.  Then youll wonder why you didnt buy them sooner.\n"}
{"text": "I had mistakenly purchased this as a wireless/blue tooth headset for my office telephony system.  Unfortunately, its not actually made for that, and I tried to return it.  Unfortunately, I have to keep the headset because during the pandemic the seller insists I return it in person to a center.  I cant do that since Im a vulnerable senior who still works at home. So, several months later, I decided to use the overly expensive headset for watching YouTube videos in my garden.  WOW.  I had used noise cancelling headsets before, and this one is incredible.  It truly cancels external noises on command, or not, its your choice.  The sound was so crisp, I had to check that I was actually hearing the headset, or the laptop.  Battery life is one full day. Okay, so I cant use this as often as a gamer would, but its a wonderful headset.  Wish I didnt buy it, but glad I did.\n"}
{"text": "The only difference I found with these international version headphones is that the default voice is Chinese, which is easily fixed in the Sony Headphones settings app. Otherwise, they are identical. The headphones themselves are very comfortable but you may notice some slight ear discomfort after 3+ hours of use, which is to be expected. The sound quality is amazing with rich, deep bass & even more bass if you use the 'Bass Boost' setting in the equalizer  I would give the active noise cancelation an 8/10. It gets rid of almost all mid-range noise, but you will hear quite a bit high & low frequencies. I have tried the Bose 700's & feel like they have slightly better ANC & are more comfortable to wear, but their bass is terrible & those headphones seem like they wouldn't take much wear & tear. So for me, the trade-offs are more than worth it & I am very happy with these headphones \n"}
{"text": "I used it on a rt flight from HK about 14.2 hours each way. Ive always been a bit skeptical about noise cancellation headphones but these blew me away. The ambient noise fades to a minor, dull hum. I still heard the flight announcements and flight attendants when they asked me questions about service. They allowed me to have the best sleep Ive been able to have on planes. The sound quality for music and the movies were excellent whether wired or wireless.\n"}
{"text": "Great sound, noise canceling is amazing as well. Great battery life, could be better but they charge quick and it is more than enough for a full day use. Nice sound with the Bluetooth and even better sound with the cable. These are great headphones if you live in a very noisy city neighborhood, make all the city sounds melt away. Comes with a really nice hard case to keep them in as well! Only cons I can really think of is they can make the ears a little warm sometimes, especially walking around outside on a warm day. They are a great buy though, you wont be disappointed!\n"}
{"text": "I bought this and a mic to replace my headset I used for gaming (Logitech G933). I have been using them for almost a week for gaming and my work. Here are my thoughts Pros: - They are much lighter and more confortable to use - Sound quality is better - Noise cancelling is really good Cons: - More setup (headphones + external mic) - More expensive - I had to use Dolby Atmos to have 7.1 while gaming - Lack of app for desktop (Mac and Windows)\n"}
{"text": "I enjoy the sound and quality of these headphones but the clamping force isn't as good as I was hoping they would be. They do have good isolation though, which gives the side effect of sweaty ears after a while. Also, if you have bigger or longer ears you will feel the sides of the cups. It isn't painful or uncomfortable but can be noticed.\n"}

{"text": "I've bought the headset to be able to concentrate and work in a noisy environment - be it a crowdy office or a home place when your kids are back from school already :) Coupled with some white-noise generating application it isolates you from the noisy environment completely. It is worth noting that the noise-cancelling system can bypass the adjustable amount of the environment so you are not completely lost from what's going on. It also can focus on voice passing it through while cancelling other sound which is a great help if you should maintain some conversation from time to time.\n"}
{"text": "This is by far the best set of headphones I have ever listened to. The noice cancelling is on point (to a fault at times lol) and the sound quality is best in class. There were some complaints about the wind noise and I will say: if it is extremely windy, there's only so much they can do; but the app does include a wind noise reduction mode which helps immensely (noise cancelling mode and pretty much any other mode is baaad in wind). When in the wind, though, I found a simple volume increase would compensate perfectly.\n"}
{"text": "I've owned Bose and Beats in the past and these are by far the best I've personally put on. Everything about them is a delight and the discount going international was worth it to me. The voice assistant is a little different but I don't use it much anyway.\n"}
{"text": "Movies, music and just noise cancellation on flights. These headphones are great. Outstanding sound quality with dynamic range. Bluetooth works great with my iPhone, and also works well when hard wired into a connection. Extremely happy with them. Only complaint if there was one is the case could use some other connection for bag attachment but honestly not a big deal.\n"}
{"text": "These are excellent headphones, I love basically everything about them, but with a few minor details, they could be better. So, these headphones have the best noise cancelling on the planet, when using this feature it is almost frightening to not be able to hear anything in the background. The sound quality is also excellent and if you dont like the default setting, you can change it in the app. My first complaint is that the touch controls on the headphones are not great and I have heard that they spas out in cold weather, however you can disable them and most of the time they work perfectly fine so I wouldnt be too worried. Also, if you have ears that stick out a lot these may not be for you because I have small ears and mine touch the insides of the ear ups. This is not a huge deal because it is not uncomfortable but it could be better. Also because I am a gamer, I had to try these on my pc. Beware, if you use bluetooth to connect its not great because it will ask you to use stereo or something called hands free AG audio or something, the difference is that the stereo is better sounding, but you cannot hear anything if the application you are using requires a microphone. The next day of using these I trued the wired connection instead and that seemed to work a lot better. So if you want to use these with your pc or console, I would recommend using the included aux cable. For gaming, the sound is not great and the stereo works, but you cant really tell where people are with it. I played several rounds of CS:GO with these and it wasn't bad, but you could get better surround sound gaming headphones for this kind of thing. I fully understand that these headphones are for listening to music, but I don't care that much. Another annoyance is that if you want to use two devices at one through Bluetooth, you have to disconnect from one and switch to the other. This was not a huge problem for me though because if you unplug them from the wired connection and turn them on it will automatically connect to your phones bluetooth. If you care about comfort for long periods of time, I would say that there are better options, but this is good enough. Today I wore these headphones for almost nine hours straight and I have a very slight headache and thats it. The headache really isn't bad though and I think I might just be sensitive to noise cancelling. The microphone on these is not bad and you can take calls with them and it will sound fine. I am not an audiophile, but I can really tell the difference between these and my cheap $40 gaming headphones. I would absolutely recommend these to anyone. Also, if you are worried about the international thing, all it means is that it has no warranty if you live in America. I do live in America, so I guess Ill just have to be extra careful. I have heard that these are very durable and probably wont break.\n"}
{"text": "No problem setting up, actually was super simple. But Im glad Im not the only one who thought the smell was nauseating. I knew someone who worked at a manufacturing plant and he always smelled like this after coming home it was awful. But more importantly, Im missing where these are noise canceling?? I bought these to do school online while I live with someone, and I could still hear everything she was doing, over my music WITH noise canceling on, rustling things around and such. Literally the reason I bought these. Sure, my air conditioning isnt AS loud. But thats about it. Maybe if these were $40 Id understand. Returning! Update: bluetooth is frustrating. I have to automatically connect (go into, say, my laptop settings, hold down the button on the headphones) every single time. And, you can't adjust the settings through the app unless you are connect by bluetooth through your phone. So, working on you laptop and connected to it? You'll have to disconnect and manually connect to your phone to change settings. I also cannot stop hearing this scratchy sound when NC is on but I have no music? Like intermittent static. Lastly, whoever loves these must not wear them for more than an hour. Longer than that, my head and ears start really hurting. I've adjusted the band several ways, it just hurts. So sad. I really really wanted to love these. I just don't see the value with the price.\n"}
{"text": "Comfort: The foam inside made it so that it was very uncomfortable feeling for my ears inside. I had to take off the ear ups and take the foam out to fix the issue. After that my ears didnt feel anymore pain. The headband is quite hard and can get uncomfortable over time. Adjustability: For a younger kid, even on the smallest setting they may not fit. I have a relatively normal sized head for an 18 year old and I was able to wear them on the smallest settingthey should add smaller settings for smaller heads. Durability: the plastic is very high quality and has resisted 20+ accidentally bumps, and scratches by the dog hitting them while having them on. Eve after this I cant see a scratch on them. That being said, sometimes when moving them, there can be some creaking. My biggest complaint here though is the earcups, they already have small creases in them, which can let in some breeze and sound sometimes. They are pictured above. Sound: I was not really impressed by the sound quality that much. As many say: it is consumer audio, the main target is good sound quality with great ANC, battery. You can adjust it via the EQ, which I have found to be really great. Some things may sound bad such as rain sounds/ASMR/Rap, but when I adjust the EQ, they sound betterdefinitely nice to have. Battery: One of the best things about these headphones. With ANC I get around 15 hours, which is the only mode I use (it cancels out more sound obviously and gives better sound quality). You can get in the 20 to 25 hour range without it. Along with the long battery, these charge VERY fastabout 23 hours of use with 10-15 minute of charge. You can also charge it with more powerful chargers because the headphones will only draw as much power as they need. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): This has been a life saver for me. It can cancel out the annoying noises such as heavy breathing, fans, talking. However, it does not cancel higher pitched noises such as tapping/scratching/and dishes well. Unfortunately ANC is not advanced enough to fully cancel out those noises. HOWEVER, I will say that with ANC and music past half volume you wont hear ANYTHING. It nearly cancels out sirens, loud/talking yelling. These are the things you put on when you just doing wanna hear it. Touch Controls: Honestly these dont work as often as I would like them to, I dont know if it is the IOS software or the headphones, but they often cut out while exiting apps. The touch functions such as pausing do not always work, it will make the beep, but the video on YouTube will just buffer (I listen with YT premium). Other issues/Disclaimers: Waking outside in the cold can cause increased malfunctioning with these, so that can be fairly annoying. dont even think about running with these on, they will clunck around too much, and the sweat could kill them. A light jog is fine though. gaming on an Xbox One with these does not work well, the cord that comes with it does not fit very well in the controller (this is 2-pronged and the headsets are three pronged AUX cables). Also you have to manually adjust the volume through the Xbox itself. The mic on this cannot be used for gaming. the mic while calling is bad and enables ambient sound, making you able to hear everything around you, which is very annoying. Overall: I dont really regret buying these because I really needed the ANC, but if you dont use ANC, the Sennheiser momentums will sound much better and he built better.\n"}
{"text": "I've had other Sony, over-the-ear headphones before and they were quite good, but these are far superior to any of those. I never really understood what ANC [active noise cancelling] meant, so I was somewhat skeptical as too the effectiveness of its claims. But once I put them on and activate the ANC, the difference in [non, ANC] and these are quite clear. I can't imagine not being able to hear, but the closest to isolation of sound which drowns-out all others is fully appreciated here. It's an eerie feeling to have someone standing beside you, speaking to you [seeing their lips moving] and you not hearing them is strange. Although, with a cupping of the right earphone, the noise-cancelling feature abates, allows you to hear people speaking. However, for the most-part, all you hear is what's coming through the headphones, a feeling of being closed-in, and for me, what's coming through the headphones is clearing than my own hearing. Strangely, it tantamount to wearing a hearing aid of total sound, if you can imagine that. Wearing these headphones, [be it phone conversation, or easy listening], I've grown accustom to not having noise around. You know, those sounds around us we usually take for granted in our everyday lives are shut out when the ANC is on, so wearing these may take some time getting use too. In closing, they do all Sony says they can, to-which I say without hesitation. The 5-star rating is justified for the everyday [ordinary listener], for those who work in sounds for a living may have a differing opinion....\n"}

{"text": "I bought this based on many reviews telling how great the sound was. I am an audiophile and didn't expect them to compete with good quality phones since the noise canceling seems to degrade the sound, but I didn't expect such grainy digital sound. Many reviews said that they were a little base heavy, but nice fun phones.They said it was way ahead of the Bose quiet comfort. If that is true, can you imagine how the Bose sound? These phones haveunacceptable sound. I almost didn't buy them because of many complaints about the head bands breaking, but I thought that if I took good care of them maybe they would not break. But I did not expect such mushy, and grainysound. I have not yet tried them on a flight, but they do seem to cancel noise effectively. but there is no way I would listen to them with music. Maybe they are made for watching films on flights, but for music: forget it. The 3 stars are for the noise canceling. These are going right back in their box. Really disappointed. update Oct 13 2019 I bought the QC35ii and have to say that I was not wrong. For a closed  back noise cancelling headphone which puts most of its cost into the NC, I am very satisfied with the SQ. It comes  close to my HD558 but still far from my $500 Shure SRH1840 which is to  be expected\n"}
{"text": "I love these headphones! I was looking for something that would allow me to listen to podcasts or audio books while I was vacuuming. I had been using my Apple Airpods, while I was doing housework, and as soon as I started up the vacuum, I had to pause the Airpods because I couldnt hear without really cranking up the volume. The other problem for me was that they didnt always stay in my ears, especially if I needed to lean over. None of those things are a problem with these Sony headphones! I had read that the app didnt always do a very good job of connecting. I have not had a problem, and I love that it immediately shows me how much battery is left. I cant give exact hours, but it lasts a long time, and charging is very easy. They are very comfortable, and the sound is amazing!!! One day I decided to listen to some Dave Koz saxophone, and I couldnt believe how beautiful it was! They come with a very nice zip-up case, and fold easily into it. If youre wondering which headphones to get (because there are a lot of them), Id definitely recommend these. (My husband and I actually tried several, including Bose, at one of the big box stores. This model was a standout for us.)\n"}

I used a different version of this product and a product from a different seller, and two years later I bought the same model. Previous versions did not have this problem, and we noticed that there was such a defect in products purchased through this seller. It is also inconvenient because the default language setting is Chinese. I was a little anxious because the price was cheaper than other sellers of the same product, but ya.. I feel there is a moral hazard to this product seller. Whoever received this product, please be sure to test the sound of the product in a quiet environment.\n"}
{"text": "Pros: Bass heavy, but very nice, clear sound. Sound profile fits very well with pop, rap and other similar music with heavy bass and these deliver on both the low and high end. Noise cancellation, when set up correctly, is the best on the market. Not much explanation needed. You could sleep through a screaming baby with these planted on. Very nice, subtle looking cans with a handy carrying case and folding feature Cons (not many) Initial software update (which took almost an hour) completely drained battery. Make sure your phone is charged too (no aux cords allowed) Battery very good (probably 12-14 hours minimum depending on volume at a minimum) Not the most comfortable headphones out of the box that I have used. Could get used to them quickly. Edit:  ***After a week or so of use they feel like clouds resting on my skull Review: these are the best sounding, highest tech and most effective noise cancelling bluetooth headphones on the market. There should be no problems for most people with the battery life, and more importantly, the quality of the sound exceeds that of competitors, most importantly the Bose quiet comfort series. It, in a personal side by side comparison, has actually outperformed my beloved audio technica m50s in every way. It may be noted I have the original M50 model with the no detachable, 10 foot long cord and a DAC cmoyBB small headphone amplifier to try to liven up the technicas to match the new cans, to no avail. 4.9/5 after a month of use. Cant really imagine too much better than this right now. Better sound than wired and best noise cancelling by far. Great headphones.\n"}
{"text": "Disliked the fact that these are the Chinese version and in China they don't allow Alexa or Google Assistant. No option to change the ambient button to work with these. Should not be labeled International version. Should be labeled Chinese version. Besides that, seem to work just like the American version. *Update*. Refund process went well and very quick. Was hoping I wouldn't get a run around and didn't. I just received my US version and it works like I was hoping. The only difference between them and the ones I returned was my new headphones have Alexa and Google. If you don't care or want those functions, then get this international version. Exactly the same without the voice assistance. Thank you, Jim\n"}

And in the airplane, it was 5-6 in spite of 10 with standard iPhone wired headphone. I very much satisfied with this.\n"}
{"text": "I purchased the international version of these headphones. They work great! 100% would purchase again.\n"}
{"text": "Purchase for my frequent plane trip.  I was amazed at how well it reduced noise and increased audio clarity.\n"}
{"text": "Box was unsealed, couple fingerprints on the headphone and slight scuffs on cushions. Nothing serious but still product was used or most likely used as display product, not brand new. Box was damaged/cracked\n"}
{"text": "Microphone quality is not what I expected, people does not understand to me very well\n"}
{"text": "Great sound quality, great AMC, battery life is insane. Worth every dollar\n"}
{"text": "The headphones deliver on what they promise. The only downside is that you can have multiple devices connected to the headphones at the same time so i have to disconnect and connect when im switching devices (but i knew about that issue before buying).\n"}
{"text": "Switched from Bose 35Q to Sony - better noise cancelling, more full audio, slightly more comfortable (less hot) with extended wear\n"}
{"text": "I have a slightly small head and these headphones wouldnt stay on at all when I would look down or up. Ive never had this issue with other headphones. Sent back immediately. Sound quality was above average but I wasnt as impressed with the noise canceling as I had hoped. The forty hour battery life is great though.\n"}
{"text": "Muy buenos pero no me gusto como suena el bajo\n"}
{"text": "This product was given to me by my sister as an early birthday gift and I absolutely love them they last long, they have a lot of bass, and the noise cancellation is beyond incredible.\n"}
{"text": "Excelentes, maravillosos, el sonido es sorprendente, buena compra, los recomiendo\n"}
{"text": "the reason give 4 start is the sounds not good as MDR-1A.\n"}
{"text": "Saving for Christmas gift.\n"}
{"text": "The noise cancellation is incredible. The sound is amazing. The range is is far. But the microphone sounds a little muffled, you sound quiet and soft on the phone to the end user. Still awesome though\n"}
{"text": "I'm glad that I waited until I got news of the Mark 4 version. The Mark 3s are still great consider there wasn't much update on the Mark 4s. Also, the price is unbeatable!\n"}
{"text": "Love them! I have the 900N's and these are at a whole different level. Great sound and decent battery life. I have been using these for conference calls and the mic is clear and the noise canceling helps drown out background noise.\n"}
{"text": "Good product, but remember to switch off  the head motion sensor if not any head movement and the Bluetooth will drop for a second\n"}
{"text": "I have been overall quite happy with these headphones. They are very comfortable, and I am pretty sensitive to pressure on my ears. The control of ambient sound is very good. The quality of sound in regard to music I listen to is a bit muffled to me. I am not sure why that is, but that is the only complaint I have. They are by far the best headphones I have had\n"}
{"text": "These are awesome. It was between these and a set of Bose. These just performed better. The noise canceling is awesome. The Bluetooth capability is great for listening to music or talking on the phone. Highly recommend!\n"}
{"text": "Muy cmodos y suena muy bien, slo falta que mejoren las frecuencias altas.\n"}
{"text": "Fantastic headphones, bought to block out my jabbering halfwit colleague. A couple of times I could just about still hear him but compared to him living inside my head is bliss. As a bonus to avoiding a murder charge ....Musically they are great and comfortable enough to wear all day !\n"}
{"text": "Works great but there is no mute function. I use it mainly for home office and they work great but the downside is that there is no mute button. That's something you expect to have in a premium headphones.\n"}
{"text": "These are even better than their predecessors, which I still have. I love the fit, ANC, sound and price!\n"}
{"text": "They work great no issues\n"}
{"text": "This product is not too tight when you wear it and covers my ear entirely. The sound quality is also very good.\n"}
{"text": "Great stuff. It is very comfortable. I can wear it for a whole day.\n"}
{"text": "Nice\n"}
{"text": "It's the best headset I ever bought for myself.i would totally recommended to anyone whose looking to purchase a headphone. By far the best. Down side is only the pairing options. Only paired to one device at a time, but it's a first world problem. Lol!\n"}
{"text": "The headphones are wonderful! Excellent price! The noise cancellation is very good and the sound quality is extraordinary! It warms your ears when it's cold outside!\n"}
{"text": "The nose cancelling is great along with the sounds quality. Recently had a flight and used them which cancelled out all the jet noise and made for a much better flight.\n"}
{"text": "This is the noise cancelling headphones in the game, I use it mostly on the subway and bus with 50% volume and noise cancelling and I hear nothing from outside. My only gripe is the mic quality during phone calls sucks.\n"}
{"text": "The noise cancellation is excellent. Sometimes it is too good that I can't even notice when people are calling me in my house.\n"}
{"text": "A little bit better than bose qc 35ii\n"}
{"text": "Great product. IMHO, better than an equivalent Bose QC.\n"}
{"text": "By far the best headphones I've owned, I'm very impressed\n"}
{"text": "Great top notch headphone. Pairs quickly. Battery life is good. Easy controls. But the damn thing doesnt work with laptops.\n"}
{"text": "Very happy with the functionality and workmanship.  I have a hearing deficit, but this sounds good.  The range is excellent.  Bluetooths can be quirky to set up, but once you do, its great!\n"}
{"text": "These are what Sony is known for..... QUALITY. You get what you pay for. Much better than the noise canceling Beats. Will be buying these again for the rest of the family\n"}
{"text": "Terrible headphones volume level does not come up\n"}
{"text": "Love it, sounds good, better battery life, but the noise canceling is vacuum sealed and its not present.\n"}
{"text": "It takes a little getting used to to turn them on and select the noise cancelling feature.....but those things are minor and I absolutely love this pair of bluetooth head phones!!!!!!!!\n"}
{"text": "I enjoyed these headphones very much but they stopped working for me 3 months after I purchased them. Im hoping Sony/Amazon acts right and gives me a replacement or return as they are very pricey\n"}
{"text": "The sound is amazing. Noice cancelling is awesome. Very comfortable to wear so far. And really like the discounted price for the international version. No regrets and lots to recommend.\n"}
{"text": "Great sound quality!\n"}
{"text": "Absolutely love these headphones. They are very comfortable, even after an extended period of wearing. The sound is great quality, and the noise cancelling is an awesome feature that helps drown out undesired noise. I am surprised at how long the battery lasts! Great investment overall.\n"}
{"text": "Everything about these are great! Bought as a gift for my husband and he loves them! May buy a second pair for myself!\n"}
{"text": "If you're thinking between these and the most go with these sony M3s hands down better than the most quiet comforts. I've owned both so you can trust my opinion.\n"}
{"text": "Just buy them! You wont regret it!\n"}
{"text": "Awesome in everything except no Microphone while connected with cable.\n"}
{"text": "Amazing.  Sound cancellation in a loud semi truck makes you feel like you're in a luxury car.\n"}
{"text": "My son says the noise cancelling is uncanny. He loves them.\n"}
{"text": "Noise cancelling wasnt as good as I had expected. Seemed as if the ear cuffs didnt seal as well as they should have on me, and it sounds as if there is a piece loose in the right ear cuff because it has been making a slight rattle when moving around ever since the second time I had worn it.\n"}
{"text": "I had some Marshal's headphones. At first, I thought this one will never be superior to my old ones. But, ufff... Just with the Android App, this headphones win my heart.\n"}
{"text": "I would recommend these to anybody that travels or listens to music at high volumes. The noise cancelation is great, and there's no distortion at high volumes.\n"}
{"text": "Excellent!\n"}
{"text": "+ good material + high quality sound + very good noise cancellation - too bad that it is not supported by ps4 - It seems that it will not last long before the leather looks old (cant clean it easily)\n"}
{"text": "Ive been through a lot of different headphones and these are the best Ive ever found. The app is great and the quick charging is convenient. Amazing product worth the money.\n"}
{"text": "The international version comes in Chinese but can easily be changed by downloading the Sony headphones app.\n"}
{"text": "The best quality\n"}
{"text": "Great sound and noise cancelling\n"}
{"text": "Headset works great except for the volume control. Sometimes when you turn it up or down you skip to the next podcast.\n"}
{"text": "This product change the way I use headphones. It sounds great, fit right and they cancelled noise so we'll. The battery cool be better but it is really good.\n"}
{"text": "The sound is second to none.\n"}
{"text": "This is my third pair of these headphones. Now each member of the family has one. We all love it.\n"}
{"text": "Perfect product. Using it for over 3 months. Perfect sound, comfort, connection, battery life...everything is awesome. MUST BUY!!\n"}
{"text": "Great battery,sound and anc. Xm4 not worth the extra 180 usd if you dont need multipoint connection feature\n"}
{"text": "I bought this on 2019 may when i was visisted to USA. At the time could not able to get in India. In this seven months i have enjoyed the quality of sound and features not even in Bose also. I very much satisfied the product, thanks to SONY.\n"}
{"text": "I use this for work conferences and it has been amazing. Great made product. Ive always been a Bose fan and this product meets up with Bose well.\n"}
{"text": "Love these. They work for long and I can focus on school and not get distracted\n"}
{"text": "its very hard to operate. international version sucks. i will reconsider the US version. noice cancelling not working properly.\n"}
{"text": "love it, would highly recommend\n"}
{"text": "I absolutely love these but why does Sony think we don't want buttons??? Pausing and skipping songs is annoying. I'd give these full marks otherwise.\n"}
{"text": "Great product. Works exactly as described.\n"}
{"text": "I purchased a 910N Sony from Costco, and got this one. Compared the two and it is night and day.  Love the M3.  All around well worth the extra few $ I spent on the M3.\n"}
{"text": "Overall too good quality, sound quality is uncomfortably superior. I have seen issue with long calls, touch controls for pause and play function It does not work as stated.\n"}
{"text": "I like this product from the beginning, but the big problem is that the product has no English version of instruction except for Chinese version.\n"}
{"text": "Multiple times this week... My hubby:  Those headphones... are FING AWESOME! Me:   Best birthday gift!!  Thank you!!\n"}
{"text": "dislike instructions for on and off. absolute noise cancelling\n"}
{"text": "Came as described\n"}
{"text": "Me gustaron, lo que les sugiero es mayor informacin del estuche, el cual pens qu no venia.\n"}
{"text": "I received the Chinese version and not the international, I can't use google assistant. Incorrect information.\n"}
{"text": "Love these, except the fit is tight, which creates sweaty ears.\n"}
{"text": "Worked fine until they didnt.  after just 2 months they stopped working. Wont turn on.\n"}
{"text": "My daughter informed me about these headphones. I was about to purchase some Bose headphones but I am so happy that I purchased these SONY's. I have some first generation Beats.  And these Sony's are truly the best headphones that I have ever purchased. The noise cancellations and sound quality is absolutely perfect. They come with a operating APP. That make them even better. I highly recommend these headphones especially for audiophiles.\n"}
{"text": "I cant say enough great things about these headphones. My favorite headphones ever, I am a causal average joe in the headphone world so for me these worked great. I use them for studying and workplace. not suitable for the gym in my opinion they are too nice.\n"}
{"text": "I purchased these headphones in 7/19 and they worked fine up until about a month ago when they stopped charging.  Now they won't turn on at all and Sony basically told me I'm out of luck and can try and get them repaired.  Have seen people with similar issues on Sony product support website with no response or fix by Sony.  Maybe I just got a defective unit, but buyer beware.\n"}
{"text": "I've been a Sennheiser fanboy for a while, but data is data, and these headphones had the supporting evidence to make me switch.  The noise cancellation is alarmingly effective, sometimes to a disorienting degree. Audio quality is fantastic.\n"}
{"text": "Ive only owned these for about two days but all I can say its pull the trigger if you want them, I slept in my mothers house and she was playing some annoying music since like 8am and these guys allowed me to sleep for another 3 hours without a hint of whatever else was happening, music sound great too I love the quality bass it produces not overwhelming just perfect, Im getting the Fiio M6 so Ill update on how it sounds through LDAC since Ive only been using my iPhone for now.\n"}
{"text": "Suenan muy bien, la batera es eterna si no los usas mucho(entre 1 y 2 horas al da) y la cancelacion de ruido es fantastica, pero no total como uno se imagina, aunque en comparacion con otros dispositivos esta a otro nivel. Por otro lado la atencin de Amazon y el tiempo de envo fue excelente, se demoro muy poco y llego en perfectas condiciones. Lo recomiendo totalmente. Soy de chile\n"}
{"text": "with these , im able to cancel out my roommate's loud voice in our living room and better concentrate on my work. Besides the noise cancelling mode there's also an ambient sound on mode, and ambient sound off. But I mostly use the noise cancelling because all of the noises in my house and from outside cam get annoying when I'm trying to concentrate. A+ rating for students and office workers imo\n"}
{"text": "I finally tested my new headphones yesterday. Great sound. Good cancellation. The optimizer worked well and afterwards it blocks the sound really well. The sound itself is phenomenal. I the noise cancellation 4 stars out of 5, as it seems yesterday, the optimizer lost its configuration and suddenly the bass amplified significantly drowning out the vocals. No big deal. You just run the optimizer again (takes 5 seconds) and you're good to go again for a smoother balanced sound. I love the headphones!\n"}
{"text": "These are a great improvement over prior models. The ears cups are larger and more comfortable, the sound is noticeably clearer and defined, with excellent range and deep bass.\n"}
{"text": "I really like the headphones. They are very good at noise cancelation even when not having it as a default. The only problem about them is that you can still here what your listening to when you take them off. I dont know about you, but I dont like people listening to my music. Besides that. They are awesome! Definitely recommend in 2020 if you just want to have headphones that have you concentrated on music or whatever your listening to.\n"}
{"text": "Exceeded my expectation\n"}
{"text": "Muy comodos, Buena calidad de audio\n"}
{"text": "Great headphones, Ive had Bose before and I can honestly say that these headphones sound and feel tons better\n"}
{"text": "Very good noise canceling, amazing battery duration, good sound (you can customize using the phone app). A little too big, but very comfortable. Good buy when compared to Bose 35II.\n"}
{"text": "I wore these while on a trip.  Did everything they were suppose to do.\n"}
{"text": "Good sound quality but not great for phone calls.\n"}
{"text": "Very comfortable and great sound !\n"}
{"text": "very comfortable, just one thing, my ear will feel a little warm once wearing it for one hour, not a big problem for me.\n"}
{"text": "Just the same quality with the global version. You save extra bucks\n"}
{"text": "These headphones are superb. The NC is excellent and does exactly what it's supposed to do. Used them on a very long flight and it totally cancelled out the engine noises, made the flight so much quieter.\n"}
{"text": "these headphones is the best sounding headphones ever.  well worth the money.\n"}
{"text": "The right side of the headphones has very little sound coming out of it. Had to stop using them because it gave me headaches listening to it.\n"}
{"text": "Everything else was great, but be aware of the fragile headband.\n"}
{"text": "Dont like volume controls Can only Bluetooth to one device at a time\n"}
{"text": "look man I was dumb and put water in them but lemme tell you something theses things are overpowered\n"}
{"text": "Had to return because it didn't state for iPhone only\n"}
{"text": "The nose cancel everything else Its on point.\n"}
{"text": "FAKE!!!...BEWARE!!! It's no the real thing. Fake Chinese Sony headphones. Returned\n"}
{"text": "Easy setup great sound quality fairly comfortable. ANC is excellent.\n"}
{"text": "Absolutely brilliant\n"}
{"text": "Battery not charging, I did reset to original settings and it still not charging and have owned it for less than a year.\n"}
{"text": "Fantastic headphones. I bought these for my wife because she gets migraines and needs good sound isolation. These work wonderfully.\n"}
{"text": "After a couple of months they started making a static noise out of the left ear when noise cancelling is activated.\n"}
{"text": "sub 60hz sound is non existent even though sony says it gets down there. that missing lower chunk really takes something out of the music. dont get if you are a basshead\n"}
{"text": "had the device for approx 1 month and the device would not charge.  contact Sony and Amazon/Woot support and working with them to get a refund. like the device but no good if cant hold a charge\n"}
{"text": "Great noise canceling and very comfortable. Does get a bit hot/sweaty if worn for longer durations (1h+). The adaptive noise canceling based on your activity is fantastic as well!\n"}
{"text": "The sound is so good. It does lose connection once in a while but gets back immediately. Noise cancellation does not totally mute the ambient sound but i havent compared this to other brands. They say its one of the best.\n"}
{"text": "Does what they say.\n"}
{"text": "I have a A/C top on my desk at work but this just gets rid of the all sound. I really loved it, and am using it each and everyday!\n"}
{"text": "Awesome deal\n"}
{"text": "Best Noise Cancelling headphones on the market for the proce\n"}
{"text": "I am new to the noise cancelling front but I like these at home. Will try them on the plane soon.\n"}
{"text": "Really a steal for what it does. The beats a cool looking but these are just better all around.\n"}
{"text": "Excellent for a noise office or commute\n"}
{"text": "They are definitely very comfortable and their battery life is amazing! A five minute charge can lead to 20-30 minutes of music\n"}
{"text": "Worth it.\n"}
{"text": "They worked great while they lasted but didn't even last three months. Currently trying to contact Woot for the seller warranty but so luck so far.\n"}
{"text": "The extending metal on the sides of the headphone broke after less than a year after buying with normal use. Shocked and disappointed.\n"}
{"text": "I've been using it for more than 4 months and I love it. Sound quality, noise cancelling are great. The only thing is controls on the headphones work so so\n"}
{"text": "It was great for my trip. Now it just sits in a box. The touch controls are not the best, I find them annoying.\n"}
{"text": "Excelente\n"}
{"text": "I'm looking for a replacement for my old Beats Studio headphones. The sound quality wasn't near as good so I immediately returned them.\n"}
{"text": "I got AirPods Pro and I have to say Sony beats the AirPods pronin noise canceling and sound loving them and Ive only had them for less then a day\n"}
{"text": "About 50 times per song, the headphones re-optimize. No way to turn it off, even if you turn it off in the settings.\n"}
{"text": "Weird wind noise from the right ear cup. I slapped the right gear cup so hard now my head hurts rip\n"}
{"text": "One big dislike they are hard to wear. Comfort is short lived. Ear pads suck. 1 star\n"}
{"text": "Excellent sound quality and noise cancellation. The only downside is that you can't listen to music while charging. The battery life however is great, so not much of an issue.\n"}
{"text": "Really great  Headphones\n"}
{"text": "Bad ergonomics, damages my ears.\n"}
{"text": "use 4 month and broken,outside quality need to be INCREASED, Really myyyyyyyyyyyyyy 200 +dollars  No, NnnNo,why, why is meeeeEeeeEee.1 feel so bad\n"}
{"text": "Lo mejores audfonos que puedes comprar, la batera rinde demasiado, y se carga sper rpido, la calidad de audio perfecta. Cancelacin de ruido increble, recomiendo este producto mucho, tengo los bose 35 y son muy superiores los Sony\n"}
{"text": "This product is excellent for the price. Exceeded my expectations and I would definitely recommend it to friends!\n"}
{"text": "Great product. I'm in love with it.\n"}
{"text": "These headphones were ALMOST perfect. But if you are buying them and expecting to use them for the gym I recommend not getting them. The headphones will not stay on your head and slide right off just when sitting down to do an excersize. I think the reason is because the swivel just above the ear muffs\n"}
{"text": "I don't even have to turn on the noise canceling most times because the ear muff's insulation is so good! great for HSPs to wear around\n"}
{"text": "The best sound quality and noice cancelling i have ever tried( Have tried air pods pro and bose headphones)\n"}
{"text": "I just loved them! The sound / the battery/ the signal and other features are completely out of this world. Im satisfied\n"}
{"text": "Very impressed. Might buy a second one.\n"}
{"text": "These headphones are top quality when is comes to noise cancelling and comfort. But as for sound quality, it's really lacking. Lots of mud in the lower-mid frequencies, and extra boomy bass when noise cancelling is activated. Using EQ with these headphones is an absolute must.\n"}
{"text": "These are the best headphones on the market right now. Hands down.\n"}
{"text": "Brilliant pair of headphones with excellent music and topnclass noice cancellation. I primarily listen to musical compositions from Tamil movies. Fits well and does not strain even if worn for long periods of time. However I've reduced a star for microphone/call quality - the other person has problems hearing me. I didn't expect this problem from such a high end headphones. Verdict: If you love music and you are buying this only for music then just go for it! If you are planning take a lot of phone calls with headphones then I wouldn't recommend these.\n"}
{"text": "These sony noise canceling phones are really well made and easy to use.Only small complaint is,tho they are bluetooth compatible,sometimes you will be in a position to have to use the regular wire without Bluetooth and the one provided is very short.Besides that all around very satisfied with the phones,great sound,comfortable fit,nicely packaged.\n"}
{"text": "This headphone do not worth it's price, in terms of all its features except the battery life. 1. The sound quality is very normal and not phenomenal or great compared to what you pay. (you can get similar quality with $50 headphone) 2. The noise canceling cause strong headache, so it was useless for me. 3. The headphone itself is not comfortable to wear more than 3-4 hours. I don't know if i had received a factory defective headphone but unfortunetly, i couldn't return it because the current events caused by the COVID-19 started to appear and i had to sold it used after 7 days. If you decided to buy this headphone, don't expect to get the expected experience for the price\n"}
{"text": "I have nothing but previous experience with headphones from a variety of retailers such as taotronics Corsair and Skullcandy these are what I consider my first premium headphones and I cannot be happier the noise cancelling if definitely the best and comes with a host of different features including opening up the microphone to hear your surroundings they bring in the details of your song to a much grander stage to really enjoy your playlist\n"}
{"text": "These are my first higher quality headphones. they are impressive and function really well. My only complaint is that the default language was Chinese. I only speak English so had to look up how to change this.  The Sony Headphones app was straight-forward to use and the language setting was found buried somewhere in it.\n"}
{"text": "so far so good! i bought this because it is almost the same as xm4 but much less expensive. Comparing to xm2 it is more comfortable. I am not an expert on sound quality. But the noise cancelling is perfect. Battery hour is around 30.\n"}
{"text": "Literally after spending 10 hours of research online for the best headphones for noise cancelling and sound amongst the various competing brands, Im so glad I purchased this set!  Ive used it for about 3 months and across two long haul flights and here and there at work, and they just continue to blow my mind.  Best headphones I ever owned!\n"}
{"text": "Overall, great sound. The one thing I discovered through a trip in Eastern Europe was that they dont do well on a shaky bus going through rough uneven roads. I couldnt use them for the most part as there was this horrible noise correlating with the shaking of the bus. I almost returned them afterwards thinking I might be better off with a pair of JBLs that I can run and train with. I also dont care for the manual sound setting on the ap. I kind of liked the Bose better in that respect, automatic equalizer. I went and tested several brands in Best Buy  before I ordered through Amazon to get an idea of the sound coming out. I was trying to decide between Bose and Sony and kept comparing them in the store. These come with a nice case, charger, and adapter,  and I think for Bose I would have had to buy the case separately.\n"}
{"text": "I love them. I'm using those for 9 months, daily. Comfortable, long battery life and very good sound with best on market noise canceling. I have no reason to upgrade to never model, or other brand. Will keep those as long as they works.\n"}
{"text": "Bought these headphones after all the positive tech reviews, but after using them for a time they have become so frustrating I am going back to my Sennheiser.  Changing between devices is a real headache - worse than any modern bluetooth product I own.  The side touch panel is not intuitive and worse, if it is bumped by a hood, sleeve, etc activates which can skip forward, back etc unintentionally.  This is a real hassle, especially on audiobooks where you have to find your place again. On top of all of that, they fall off my head... I often wear headphones to listen while doing other tasks - if I look up or move my head too much (not vigorously) they slide off.  I've never had this before.\n"}
{"text": "The charging time is extremely fast,the noise canceling is the best and the sound quality is excellent.\n"}
{"text": "La cancelacin de ruido es espectacular ... Muy contento con la compra\n"}
{"text": "I can wear them all day without discomfort. Cancels noise very well\n"}
{"text": "If you really want to enjoy this product make sure you have a device that supports LDAC otherwise it is an overkill.\n"}
{"text": "Perfecto todo! Esperaba menos y me sorprendi\n"}
{"text": "Just buy it, I'm glad I bought this instead of the ANC Crusher\n"}
{"text": "These are the best headset I have ever put on my head\n"}
{"text": "The adjustment strap broke after normal use, can not adjust it anymore.\n"}
{"text": "best noise cancellation i've ever tried\n"}
{"text": "Incredible noise-canceling!\n"}

{"text": "Some of the best headphones I've owned\n"}
{"text": "Great set of headphones.\n"}
{"text": "This is a very good product.\n"}
{"text": "We had to disconnect the touch feature because when anything touched the headphones the voice calling became activated. After accidentally calling several people, we researched online and saw that was an issue with this product.\n"}
{"text": "Why is the charging cord so short?  Had to purchase a longer one.\n"}
{"text": "These headphones are great. I work in a very noisy work environment, and these headphones block out all kinds of noise. Battery life is stellar. I work 10 hr days and they always leave me with 75-80% battery life.\n"}
{"text": "amazing sounds, clarity, im so happy i bought this. other headphones, airpods crap not worth it\n"}
{"text": "Love it. Nothing is different from the local Best Buy store. It works amazingly.\n"}
{"text": "No issue with seller. Item appears new!\n"}
{"text": "What isn't there to love? Noise cancellation, all you'll hear is your music. Bass and clarity, you can feel the speakers pulsate. Battery life, don't worry about charging it too often.\n"}
{"text": "This is the best present Ive bought myself this year!  The battery life is true to what they say.  And it cancels out all office noise in the background.  I like them better than the Bose pair we have at home.\n"}
{"text": "I love these headphones, they sound so good. The bass and vocals are clean and loud yet punchie, and the eq settings can change the sound if you don't like how it sounds.\n"}
{"text": "The headphone work great and the noise cancelling is the best I have ever tried\n"}
{"text": "Just the same that cost $100 extras\n"}
{"text": "Great product. Needs a slightly more sturdy construct\n"}

{"text": "They work far, far better than my old Covin's. While not the four times better than they would have to, to justify their 4X price. Dollar for dollar, over the Covin's, they are worth the price $300 price. I have been told the audio is not great for those on the receiving end of a phone call with these. Also, you can only hook them up to one device at a time which is not a problem for me since I never use anything but wired earbuds on calls 95% of the time.\n"}
{"text": "Beautiful and sleek, very lightweight compared to the 100xm2 and much more spacious on the ears. Took a bit to set up with the app for the update; however, its definitely necessary for the customization aspect. Great sound quality and noise cancelation. Case was slimmed down and came with everything neat and in perfect condition. 5/5 a slam dunk for Sony yet again. Side by side comparison of M2's and M3's\n"}

{"text": "I owned the first model of these headphones and loved them and this new version still blew me away. They are 100% worth the price and I prefer them to both the top models from Bose. These headphones are lightweight and comfortable, the sound is fabulous and with the app, you can customize it to what you want, and the noise cancellation is unparalleled which is perfect for if you fly or have to focus. I'd recommend these to anyone in a heartbeat.\n"}
{"text": "These are as good as everyone says. The noise canceling is amazing and the sound quality is great. The bass is powerful and surrounding and it holds up nicely at higher volumes. My only complaint about these headphones is comfort. At least in my case, My ears get hot quite quickly so I find myself taking them off after every 10 to 15 minutes for a few seconds just to cool off a bit. You might not run into this problem, but I had to take a star because of it.\n"}
{"text": "Amazon buyers beware of this seller, I had bought those headphones, because I love the Sony WH-1000xm3 more than the 1000Xm4.  It was supposed to be the international version, but when I received the package I saw that it is the chinese version, and the Google assistant could not be activated.\n"}
{"text": "the sound is plastic, it is not suitable for games, rock music turns into noise.\n"}
{"text": "So I've had these long enough for a first impression review and so far wow these are awesome! I was skeptical at first because the international version doesn't have a factory warranty but these have impressed me so far. I did however have the infamous problem with hissing coming from the right ear piece but a software update from the app fixed it for me.  I will update if something changes.\n"}
{"text": "Great music quality and comfortable wearing. Just one question, how can I both connect my computer and my phone as the headphone connecting devices? I follow the instructions online but can only successfully connect one device. If I want to add another as the bluetooth connecting device, what I can do is to remove the connect with the previous device (not disconnect but totally remove it), but I think it says it can connect multiple devices, right? So how can I do that? Thank you.\n"}

{"text": "What can I say that hasn't already been said about the WH-1000XM3's. The sound quality is great. It's extremely comfortable. The Bluetooth connectivity is great. You can download the companion app to tinker with the settigns, but a heads up is that it'll most likely have a software update available. So set aside 10-15 minutes to let it update.\n"}
{"text": "These are being used in a work environment with quite a bit of background noise by machinery.  Reduces the constant drone of the machine.\n"}
{"text": "Have had them for nearly a week and feel like life is better with these headphones on. The noise cancelling works great for me since I live on top of a busy intersection in LA. The sound quality seems superb to me, can hear parts of the music that gets drowned out with the other surrounding sounds. The earphones themselves are super comfy; can ear them for hours.\n"}

{"text": "I like the wired / bluetooth option. They sound great too!.\n"}

{"text": "I haven't tried all brands but out of all the ones I tried the noise cancellation is great.\n"}
{"text": "These headphones are the best headphones! Basically everything about them are great, the best part is the noise cancelling, which exceeded my expectations by a ton! The sound quality is also great, with the equalizer tuned correctly, there is deep and clear bass but also strong enough treble and mid range. They are also very comfortable, and wearable for long periods of time. Some cool features I love on these are the touch sensitive controls, which are very intuitive and easy to use. You can also cover the whole touch pad and the noise cancelling turns off, which allows you to have a quick conversation with someone, which is great and not many other headphones offer that feature, if any. I also like the red accents on the Sony badges (I have the black colored headphones). The battery life is unreal. I get about 30 or more hours with regular noise cancelling on, and I only have to charge them for 2.5 to 3 hours!! I use these around 2 hours a day on average so I only have to charge them every 2 weeks or so. If you are looking for good battery life, expect amazing from these. If I absolutely had to give a con, the only one I can think of is that there is slight, and I mean slight (emphasize slight) distortion in certain situations, but this might very well be the songs Im playing and the quality of them, and it doesnt happen often and its very slight, so dont let this affect you buying or not buying these if youre buying them. So, as a summary, these headphones are great. For 250 or so dollars, I think these give more quality and better sound and nc than some way more expensive headphones, and headphones at this price point. Five stars without a doubt, I would give it 6 or more stars if I could!\n"}
{"text": "TL;DR: Buyer beware, the warranty unlike other big companies (e.g. Apple and Bose) is geo-locked. This applies even in cases where the product is defective (and they admit as much). So if you plan to travel for semi-long periods of time and expect customer service go with Bose. I got them in the US, as I was going to spend several months there. I initially loved the sound quality and the noise cancelling. I had to leave the US prematurely due to COVID-19. The day after I left the US I started hearing wind like noises in the left ear-cup, I looked online to see if others customers had had similar experiences, some of them had. They all instructed me to call the customer service office and tell them what was going on, as it was a defective unit and still under warranty I would get a replacement sent to me. So I contacted my local Sony customer service agency, they told me that since I had bought them in the US the warranty wouldn't cover me in my current location and if I wanted them to take a look at them I would need to pay a service fee and then cover the cost of replacements. I promptly called the US customer service, I told them what I had experienced, leaving out the fact that I wasn't currently in the US, as I didn't want that to change the response they would give me. They told me that it was a defective unit and would change it at no cost. They told me that its a somewhat common issue and that the standard policy was to replace the unit. When I told the US office that I wasn't in the US due to COVID-19, they told me to contact them when I was back in the US. I was happy and talked back to my local office, thinking that if they heard what they told me from the US customer service they would change the approach. They informed me that the warranty was local and that they couldn't honor the promises given by the US office. I then called the US office again and explained my situation. They told me that they can't promise that it will be covered under warranty if I'm not inside the US within a year, even though the complaint was started 5 weeks after buying the product. I then called the US office again and explained my situation. They told me that they can't promise that it will be covered under warranty if I'm not inside the US within a year, even though the complaint was started 5 weeks after buying the product. Update: Got the headphones in the US, sent them to the specified location, they told me they would replace them. Sent them through FedEx the doorman at the building says the truck never showed up. FedEx said that they didn't accept the package and got sent back to the sender. Called the Sony support team to see what's going to happen they told me that they can't find the info on the \"return to sender\" delivery so they will follow up with the case but wouldn't provide me with the name, or email or any other means of contact to follow up with them\n"}
{"text": "At first, I was very happy with these.  I have a large head and they fit, and they have good sound quality. However, the microphone quality seems low, as in almost every call I made with them, someone told me the quality was awful, so I use a different microphone when using them on the computer. That seems strange given the price point and quality of output sound. After a year of using them with a large head, the constant taking them on and off has caused the plastic parts in the extension bands to start to break.  I really hate products like this that have small plastic parts that ruin the entire product when they wear down. I expected better overall quality from Sony for such premium headphones.  I've been more happy with my MRD-7506's despite the lack of bells and whistles on them.\n"}
{"text": "I bought these as my travel schedule was increasing. I was amazed at the difference it made while traveling on the airplane.  A majority of the engine noise is simply not there, allowing me to work or sleep. Sound quality is also very good, even offering the immersive 360 experience if you subscribe to audio services w/ those offerings.  The volume is not crazy loud, but loud enough given the noise cancelling feature. I use these at home for Google Hangout, Skype, and telephone calls. The mic works very well. Battery life is surprising. Google Assistant/ Alexa support is an added bonus. Down side is that you have to give up the ambient noise switch button for Google or Alexa. Would be better if you could have both. Great set of noise cancelling headphones.\n"}
{"text": "These are some fantastic headphones, truly. They arent just good from the perspectives of noise cancelling and Bluetooth technology, they are genuinely solid monitor headphones, as well. You need only change some of the many customizable settings. The sound quality is very high, and excellent throughout low, mid, and high ranges. The sound is spacious, and the level of detail is phenomenal. I actually expected less from this set of cans, but ended up with what have become my go-to listening option for most all scenarios. They are versatile, capable, and relatively reasonably priced. They even have their own app for sound customization and fitting. Seriously good headphones.\n"}
{"text": "The headphones are amazing definitely worth it especially for the reduced price. The only problem i had with them is because there the international version the headphones were originally in chinese. However i was able to change it to English in the app but for some reason it wont let me change the nc/ambient button do alexa or google assistant it only lets it change the noise cancellation or another option in Chinese that i cant read because i dont speak Chinese. But besides that they are amazing headphones that i cannot recommend enough.\n"}
{"text": "I will be updating my review to see if these are going to be something great but so far I really like what I got. I purchased these for $120 at a wholesale store and they turned out to be an amazing purchase. I find these to be comfortable for my big head and the quality of the sound for the money seem to be right on the money. These may not something that $400 dollar pair can do but it can be something that I can keep around for years.\n"}
{"text": "Love love these headphones. I upgraded from a 2013 pair of Parrot Ziks to these and the sound quality improvement was very noticeable, as well as the lack of background noise, and easily twice the battery life of the Ziks. These cans are also much more comfy over long periods - just ever get tired of them being on, even on long flights. The ONLY thing I don't get it why Sony.. WHY can I not charge them while listening? I get the low battery warning, plug them in and it just shuts down - can't turn them on while it's charging.  Which engineer was in charge of that decision, Sony? I still give them a 5 star since you really have to be lazy to not charge them when you have a chance since they last for several hours.\n"}
{"text": "The noise cancellation on these while making a phone call is not only NOT noise cancelling, but they are noise amplifying. It takes the feature of \"ambient\" background noise and BLASTS it in your ear while you are trying to have a conversation. So your 1:1 conversation sounds like you are in an auditorium of people shouting. Also if you are in the middle of a phone call and a random person walks by you while talking, it will zone into that random person's conversation and play it to the person you are talking to. If you ever plan on making a phone call using these, DON'T. I am returning these to purchase the Bose 700 headset which has much better call quality alongside more evenly spaced music quality.\n"}
{"text": "I was very happy with it until one day a noise started in my left ear. It's like white noise. I can't find a solution for it and Sony doesn't have a clue about it. They ask me to send the headphones but I'm on the other side of the world. The one thing that I can say, think twice before buying this, looks like this happened to a lot of people with some variations in the problem. I don't think a 300 USD product should have this kind of problem.\n"}
{"text": "After using headphones for almost 3 weeks I'm happy with this headset: nice sound quality, great NC and decent life battery. also, they look great and nicely seats on top of the head :)\n"}
{"text": "Excellent\n"}
{"text": "not recommending at all, 3 months i got already issues with audio, cant use it anymore! too bad i dont have protection when i got it! totally disappointing! i wont buy Sony again!!!!\n"}
{"text": "I have always found it very uncomfortable to wear over the headsets. This one is amazingly comfortable even up to 5 hours at a stretch. Also I only drained the battery to 80% after having them on for 9 hours on 2 flights.\n"}
{"text": "Good sound\n"}
{"text": "excellent headphones\n"}
{"text": "It just vacuums up all noise. The material around the muffs is so soft and supple. These are some real high quality cans!\n"}
{"text": "I like it very much\n"}
{"text": "I've wanted a pair of these for awhile now, and can honestly say they are worth the hype.\n"}
{"text": "I love these headphones and they would be perfect if they could sync to multiple devices. Maybe the XM4 will be perfect.\n"}
{"text": "I have now had the \"Beats Studio 3\" (Overpriced  that celebs were literally PAID to wear in movies and on basketball courts), the \"Bose 700\" (Amazing sound, but \"full battery\" went from 20 hours to 16 hours after only a month  ) and now these \"International Sony MX3\"s.  These Sony's sound at least as good as the Bose, have WAY more battery life, better range of movement for a more comfortable fit, and have Google and Alexa built in. (LOTS of audio features as well) I had started to wonder before they arrived if there would be a drop in quality since I had never purchased an \"international\" item before. I can say these are just a regular set, just like you'd buy at Best Buy for $100 more. No drop in quality, good Sony product. Language defaults to English and all paperwork was English as well. Very happy with my purchase!\n"}
{"text": "These headphones are probably the only thing keeping me alive right now. Picture this: My apartment is located DIRECTLY in front of a dog park. My apartment is flanked both left, right, and above by neighbors who have screaming kids. Occasionally, the parents even choose to join the kids in screaming at each other. And to top it all off, my walls may as well be made of cardboard with the amount of sound reduction they provide. So I am THE PRIME CANDIDATE for determining whether or not these things can block out sound. And I am pleased to say: They do. They are light and comfortable on the head to wear for long periods of time, which is a necessity at this point for me. The noise cancellation alone (no music playing) is good enough to mostly drown out common droning sounds (such as a microwave whirring or the AC) and decently lowers the level of louder ones (it can't completely drown out the engine sounds on the airplane, but it definitely quiets it down to a comfortable hum). However, when it comes to the inconsistent sounds, like a dog barking, or the neighbors yelling about their relationship falling apart for the third time in a week, that's when the noise cancellation needs a little help from some music. Rest assured, even for the most nuclear of arguments (kids crying and dogs barking included), I've found that just medium to medium-low volume music is usually enough to completely drown everything out. You put on some \"Beach Sounds with Pan Drums playing in the distance\", and that's all you need to escape the sound-hell you've placed yourself in by going with the bargain-bin apartment complex instead of the nicer one. Worth every cent in my books.\n"}
{"text": "The sound quality is fantastic. The ap offers a variety of configurations.  I gave it 4 stars because the seller was not clear on what is being bought.  The device is set up for the Chinese market. So, all of the instructions and the voice assistant is in Chinese. You have get the app, and change the voice format to English. But it does not change all of the print in the App to English.  In addition, I recommend connecting your headphones to you phone via Bluetooth.  Then download the app.  If you download the app and then try to connect via Bluetooth using the app, it may not connect.\n"}
{"text": "First, I was very upset to see that the package came with only Chinese instructions and manual, not English. This is more of a critique of the seller than the product, but the headphones themselves were also set to Chinese, with no way of changing them to English, so it is also a critique of the product. Pros: 1) Very good sound quality. I'm not a professional, I just listen to music all the time, but it seems comparable to a wired headset I own, which is very impressive. Mic quality is also very good, and calls are very clear. 2) Product comes with aux cord for optional wired listening, and airplane connector. 3) Adjustable noise cancellation (especially the option to temporarily disable it by cupping the right ear) is very nice, and touch controls are also relatively responsive and nice. 4) Can be used without the app, although many options are only available through the app. 5) Battery life is amazing; I listened for 4-5 hours and only used up 10% of the battery, on the other hand I charged it for 2-3 hours and it went from 20% to full. (it may actually take less time than that, I only checked in at that point) Cons: 1) Feels very uncomfortable after a couple of hours of use. This seems to be a unique problem to me, judging by other reviews of the product, so maybe it's just my head shape, but I could feel a lot of pressure on the top after only a couple of hours of use. 2) Charger is designed to plug into a computer, so it only has a USB at the end. (brick does not come with product, but I was able to use a phone charger's brick) 3) Plastic frame doesn't feel very secure. After a previous set of headphones had the plastic frame snap on me, this doesn't bode well for its longevity. 4) Active noise cancellation feels underwhelming. Perhaps it's because I don't have much to compare it to, but I could still hear myself walking with the noise cancellation turned to max, which seems like a bit of a let down. Overall, I feel like a got a good product at a good price, but that was at ~$180. I would not be satisfied if I had paid the original $250 that this was when it came out.\n"}
{"text": "I will do my best to keep this short, logical, and to-the-point Sound:  As advertised.  Super lows without flutter and extreme highs without clipping. Aesthetics:  Great materials.  All-day wear without ear fatigue.  Visually smaller than perceived however, perfect fit each wear. Battery Life:  As or better than advertised.  I go a week before re-charging mine.  Powering on and off frequently usually draws extra power but not with these.  After 10 hours, my XM3's still have 70% battery life. Touch controls:  Works as advertised and there is no \"too sensitive\" touch response.  The response is as advertised and responds exactly as instructed if user input is correct. Sound deadening:  By far excellent.  I run on my treadmill and never hear my feet hit or the sound of the treadmill motor. Sony App:  If you set it to automatically adjust, it will monitor your movement and adjust the noise cancellation.  If you are walking in a city, the noise cancellation will reduce so you can hear what needs to be heard in a city but if you or your phone (has the app) is sedentary, the noise cancellation will kick in and only your music will be left.  The frequency adjustment and surround capability is good.  Not great. Overall:  To be happy with your purchase and to have no buyers remorse, get these.  I am not paid or sponsored by Sony.  Just an honest review of a psychological sound buff.\n"}
{"text": "If these is one thing you take away from this review, let it be that the noise cancelling on these headphones is absolutely phenomenal. I cannot praise it enough. Like many of you in the year 2020, I am stuck at home under quarantine due to Covid-19. And for the past 3 weeks I have not slept a wink due to the noisy upstairs neighbors who have 3 kids running around 16 to 18 hours a day. It honestly sounds like a bunch of pro-wrestlers practicing upstairs, but due to the quarantine there's been very little I've been able to do about it. So left to my own devices I tried using ear plugs, ear muffs, and even white noise to try and block out the sound. Obviously none of this worked, at all. In desperation I decided to buy the SONY WH-1000XM3 headphones. I'd heard of noise cancelling headphones, but didn't really think they could be all that effective. I mean, how good could they be? Well it turns out they turn a loud apartment into almost complete silence. I barely hear any of the pounding on the roof. Sometimes if I have the music low enough, I'll hear a very distant thud, but that's about it. For that alone I cannot recommend these headphones enough. I've never written a review on Amazon, but these headphones deserve it. If you need noise cancelled, these head phones will cancel your noise. I'm not an audiophile so I couldn't tell you much about the audio quality, but it sounds great to me. Five out of five stars.\n"}
{"text": "These are probably the best sounding bluetooth headphones that reasonable money can buy. After demoing them side by side, I can say they sound significantly better than the Bose QC 35s and 700s. Comfort-wise, they are acceptable. They're not quite as comfortable as the Bose QC 35s (the stock earcups are better), but they are a little more comfortable than the Bose 700s. However, as far as noise-canceling headphones go though, they're among the more comfortable. They suffer from too much clamping force, and the earpads are a little too stiff and tight (perhaps they will wear down a bit with more use?). This is part of what makes them so effective as noise-canceling headphones though. If you want to make them a bit more comfortable, get the Dekani replacement earpads - you lose a little bit of NC effectiveness, but what you gain in comfort is worth it in my opinion. These get dinged a star because the touch controls are, in a word: frustrating. Physically switches or buttons would have been much better. The touch controls are very easy to accidentally hit and don't register half the time when I actually want to use them. You can turn them off in the Sony app if you want to. Speaking of which, the Sony app is rather nice and offers more useful features (such as extensive equalization options) than the Bose app. Overall, these are very easy to recommend if you need a pair of bluetooth NC headphones for travel/plane or loud office use. If you don't need NC or blueooth, there are a lot of better, more comfortable headphones out there, many of which are less expensive. For instance, the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pros, which cost half as much, are twice as comfortable, and sound better.\n"}
{"text": "I'm not an audiophile by any means, just a normal every day music listener so I'm not too technical. Experiences I've had in the last 3 days of owning them.. I can tell you that I only knew the lawn was being mowed outside due to the smell of fresh cut grass, I didn't even noticed the noise from the mower and weed wacker going simultaneously. It cut out the obnoxiously loud chopper (motorcycle) that blasts by my apartment. I only caught the end the engine noise when I took off the headphones. I find the touch controls are not that finicky as people state, I do live in a very cold weather state so we will see about cold weather use once fall and winter it. THE ONE WARNING I WANT TO PROVIDE TO BUYERS: I'm a cheap **** and went with the international seller version, not really knowing what that meant, because it was cheaper. I opened the box and 75% of the instructions were in Chinese. When turning the headset on for the first time it was in Chinese. I was able to change the language on the app they have you install, and there is one minor incontinence, after the first system update it reverted back to Chinese, however I was able to use my settings that it let me back up so it's not a huge problem. 5 Star Headphones regardless.\n"}
{"text": "I have always loved Yamaha and Sony products, well thought out and great designs. I have tried many different headphones, more expensive and cheaper, but for comfort, sound quality, and noise-canceling the SONY WH-1000XM3's blow the competition out of the water. and absolutely love them. The mics are not as good as the Jabra's, for sure, but I'm all about the quality of sound when listening to music, podcasts and calls, these over-ear headphones are the best. Sooooo, comfortable, no pinching or pressure that gives you the pain of headaches after a few hours, these I can keep on for hours and hours due to the comfort and amazing battery life. I may even get the new M4's I love these things so much for my music studio work.\n"}
{"text": "EDIT: After 2 months of use, I began hearing an irritating scratching noise out of the right headphone. This is apparently a common manufacturer defect. Have spent a week in customer support limbo, but Sony will not uphold it's 1-year warranty. Go spend your money on some Sennheisers if you want something that will actually last. Original Review: First off, these are fantastic headphones. The sounds is clear and enjoyable, wonderful for modern music and they even hold their own on more airy classical and jazz recordings, though probably a bit bass-heavy for some audiophiles. The battery life is superb as well, I've been using them for a week and have yet to need to charge them. I'm able to use them for calls in quiet spaces without an issue. Pairing them with my devices is a breeze, I haven't even bothered with Sony's software as it seems like a pain and in my experience is entirely unnecessary. Comfort is maybe where they lack a bit, I notice after an hour or two I start to feel some discomfort wearing them but overall they're still better than any other travel-minded headphones I've used. However there is one thing that is maybe worth mentioning. I bought the International version of these headphones, and it is clear that these were meant to be sold in China. The instructions for setting them up are in Chinese, the voice you hear when turning them on/off or pairing devices is a Chinese woman. Aside from a taking a bit of extra time interpreting the pictures on the instructions pamphlet, this hasn't been a problem for me and I kind of like the novelty of having the headphone speak to me in Chinese. But I feel it's worth mentioning that the headphones you receive may not have been produced for an English-speaking market. Overall a fantastic set of cans for those who want a pair of travel-oriented, modern sounding headphones with great noise cancellation and are looking to pick up a second language on the side.\n"}

{"text": "These are great until the plastic on the headband snaps, which it did for me after a year of normal use.  It's out of warranty so costs nearly $200 to repair by Sony's recommended US vendor.  It's such a shame to let such good technology go to waste because of flimsy construction.  This is why there's so much e-waste: large companies only care that you buy things, not that they last.\n"}
{"text": "I like the headset noise canceling works well in the airplane. I was seated close to kids and babies. It's not 100% silence maybe for safety reasons but I almost can't hear my surroundings. Kinda scary at first but I got used to the noise cancelled. The sound quality expected from Sony. Tried many Sony and non Sony headphones, ear pieces since Walkman in the 90s and I have to say this is just nice.\n"}
{"text": "I had bought the earlier model (WH-1000XM2) after comparing it with few different options (Bose/Sennheiser/Sony) and was impressed by the audio output, but the mic quality was worst than my dollar store mic. I had hoped that this latest model will fix the mic issue, but alas I will have to settle for Bose. Call quality on WH-1000XM3 is abysmal. I enjoy the noise cancelling headphone but the poor call quality makes me not want to buy any Sony headsets again.\n"}

{"text": "I got the WH100M2 headphones about a year ago. They were great. Long battery, great cancellation, good sound. Only problem was they were kind of heavy and didn't grip well. I took great care of them and one day, they just stopped charging. No reason. They worked fine the day before, and then they didn't. A clear defect and definitely not something I would ever expect from a $300 pair of headphones after only a year. I called customer service, and they told me that's just too bad! It had been a year so they don't care. I explained they were likely defective straight out the factory; they hadn't been broken or dropped, there was most likely a cold wield or something internal. They said they didn't care. I told them selling a defective product was theft, they said they didn't care. I don't appreciate being treated that way. I used to be a big Sony guy but I definitely won't be swindled by a Sony product ever again.\n"}

{"text": "I purchased these headphones to replace my Bose Quietcomfort 15 (without Bluetooth). After reading all the reviews and watching YouTube videos on the Sony headphones, I was expecting stunning performance. I was disappointed. First, the setup process was lengthy and frankly loaded with BS. You have to download the Sony APP then agree to Sony collecting your data, including your location at all times, and agreeing to let Sony share this data. Sony makes it clear that the data will be shared with third parties and law enforcement, if requested. Law Enforcement!!!! The reasons for collecting your location data was to let the headphones \"learn\" about your environment to automatically adjust the noise canceling. Really???? Does that mean that the noise canceling processor cannot adjust based on the what the microphone pickup in real time? Then, you have to go through a process of photographing your ears so the Sony software can better adjust the sound to the shape of your ears. This had many \"failures\". I had to get a friend to \"manually\" take the pictures of my ears before the photos were accepted. Again, really?!?!!! I mean, photos of your ears, REALLY?!?!?!!!! Sony brags about the \"360 Reality Audio\". However, for the \"360 Reality Audio\" to function you must download another third party APP. After a free trial period you must pay monthly for the APP. I listened to the headphones with and without the \"360 Reality Audio\" and heard NO DIFFERENCE. I ask, is this more BS? After this lengthy, frustration filled setup, I was able to finally listen to the headphones. I did a comparison with my 10 year old Boses Quietcomfort 15 headphones using my iPad. The difference was clear and stunning. My Quietcomfort 15's outperformed the Sony in every way. Significantly!!!! The Sony's were overly heavy with the lows. The sound was compressed with the higher frequencies muffled or missing. My personal advice is to pass on the Sony Headphones. I'm going try the new Boses 700 and compare them to my Bose Quietcomfort 15's. I hope not to be disappointed. We will see.\n"}
{"text": "These are great when you're on the road and only have one bluetooth device with you.  They sound good, do a good job with noise canceling, and are comfortable. Unfortunately not being able to switch between multiple bluetooth devices is a fatal flaw for me as it makes them essentially unusable at home. Like I'm sure most people in  modern times I have a lot of devices at home that have bluetooth.  My phone, PC, laptop, iPad, even my TV has a bluetooth connection, and all of these are active in sleep mode. That means when I turn on my XM3 headphones it could connect to any one of these devices, and the XM3 gives me no way to cycle through them.  If for instance I want to use my XM3 headphones on my PC I have to walk around and manually disable the bluetooth connection on my phone, laptop, ipad, and even TV to assure that the XM3's will connect to the PC and not one of the other devices. In practice, I just end up not using them.  Sony support barely even understands the issue and when they do understand it they say \"meh, buy the XM4's maybe it will be supported on those\".\n"}
{"text": "I have two pair of these. I bought one, then received one as a gift. I have had them for a year and have used them heavily. The noise cancelling is sublime. I pop them on when the family is being loud. I wear them when riding in the car. I wear them when working outside or in the garage. They suppress loud sudden noises. Sometimes I nap in them. On conference calls, people say I sound great. I own a total of 6 pair of noise cancelling headphones; these are the only ones that I can take calls on. On a recent call, I switched from EarPods to these, and people immediately said I sounded better. I have been very happy with these headphones, but they are fragile. The thin plastic bridge on all four of the joints have broken. I worked around this by using zip ties to hold the headphones together. This is absolutely a design flaw - there is not enough meat on the thin little plastic bridge to keep it together. Sony needs to redesign this with a larger piece, or move to metal. Otherwise I love them. No way I could return them at this point for a repair, and the replacement would have the same issue, so the zip ties will do the job.\n"}
{"text": "These seem to top every 'best buy' list at the moment, and that may well be fair if your priorities are sound quality or battery life. I bought these to aid working from home, to shut out the neighbour's piano, or screaming kids, or DIY and allow me to concentrate in peace. I found them uncomfortable after about 15 minutes and when noise cancelling is active (which wasn't as effective as I'd hoped - I could still hear plenty) there was a background hum/white noise unless I played music, which wasn't what I wanted to do. I also found that noise cancelling created a feeling of pressure that became painful, and without playing music I could hear/feel a regular pulse as - I presume - the headphones monitored the external noise it was seeking to cancel. I looked at plenty of video reviews before buying, and now realise that all those reviews were buy men (who I'm guessing have bigger heads - I'm not petite but these were too big for mine) who spent more time talking about the bass and gesture controls, and not about whether you could comfortably wear these for hours at a time to concentrate on work. If that's what you want these for, you may find them as disappointing as did. I have returned them.\n"}
{"text": "I bought these a month ago to help with working from home while the house is full of people because the reviews I had read were very good. They are extremely comfortable. I wear glasses and have found that there is no uncomfortable pressure exerted by the headphones. Generally, they are very light and could easily be worn all day. Regarding sound quality, they sound fantastic! The quality is superb. I can understand why some people describe the bass as 'muddy', because it can be a bit overwhelming. But with some tweaking of the equaliser settings on the Sony app, I found the perfect settings and they sound great. One of the main reasons I bought then was for the noise cancelling and this is one area where they are not as good as I was expecting. Sitting in my house and working while the TV is on, I can still hear some of the programme my kids are watching. If my son claps his hands, I can hear it clearly. The same is true for running water and other sounds - including speech, which is disappointing because that was where I expected them to work the best. That said, for steady constant noise they work a treat. The controls on the right earphone work brilliantly - especially the option to cover the earphone to temporarily quiet what your listening to and turn on active pass through to hear what's going on around you. Overall, I would recommend these headphones, but the most cancelling is a little disappointing.\n"}
{"text": "I've become annoyed with ear buds and bought these as an alternative. The sound quality is amazing, I really wasn't expecting them to sound so good, but with LDAC enabled on my BT connection, I'm hearing music in new ways. I run with these on, they grip my head without being uncomfortable and have plenty of extension capability. The noise cancelling is very impressive, surprising even. There are two gripes, the touch controls aren't that accurate if you have any moisture on your hands. The other is the sound (bong) when you change activity, you can fix this from the app, so thats OK. The battery life seems good, ran for two hours with volume on 11, they lasted without complaint.\n"}
{"text": "After enjoying a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort phones for a couple of years I had misgivings about shifting to the Sony ones for replacement. Who doesn't hate dropping a good horse as the race goes on. But I have to say these Sony headphones surpass the Bose units by a good bit in noise reduction and slightly in battery length, which I'd say is in the 12-14 hour range of use. The Sony phones have two hard to find buttons on the left side. They are the major controls. The phones seem to hook up via Bluetooth easier than the Bose. The charge cable that came with the headphones is just 5 inches long. You'd think Sony could provide a decent power charging cord on something this expensive! Replacement of 2.5 meter is about 10.\n"}
{"text": "The headphones provide very good noise cancellation, even for human voices. Very light and comfortable to wear. And I periodically forget they are on my head. On the flip side there are a few issues: * Very rarely, the headset just starts to pass-through amplified background noise. Recalibration always helps. * Bluetooth connection with my Macs/iPhones is fairly reliable. However, if I use BT dongle on Linux boxes it tends to drop from time to time. * Microphone(s) is not suitable for voice recording. Hence you may sound very quiet or illegibly on conference calls. But your software may be able to fix that, so mileage may differ. * Music playback is not very colourful due to the noise cancellation design and limitations of Bluetooth connection. But that to be expected. * They look brittle and will likely break in hands of a not careful owner. In general, I am fairly happy with the purchase as the drawbacks are either fixable by software updates or due to prerequisite of noise cancellation.\n"}
{"text": "When they're working fine they're great.  Sound quality is amazing, battery life is incredible.  They're not bad at noise cancelling but Bose are better.  What is really irritating is the app.  i use iPhone and iPad.  why, oh why does the app not change orientation when the device does.  The headphones drop the Bluetooth connection about 5 minutes after you connect to them and then re-connect themselves about 15 seconds later no matter where you are. Connection instructions are lousy.  The headphones connect automatically to the last device you connected them to.  If you want them to connect them to a different device that you have previously paired them with then you have to hold the 'On' button down for around 7 seconds but it does not make that clear in the manual.  Same if you have already connected to one device and you want to pair with a further device.  Again not clear in the instructions.\n"}
{"text": "I bought these after my second set of Soundcore NC headphones stopped working again. Id been finding it difficult to justify the cost but at 239, I decided to go for it.... It was the right thing to do. These headphones are next level. Noise cancelling is amazing, blocking out almost everything and allowing me to concentrate. Making calls is also excellent. The headphones play a bit of your own voice back in so you dont end up shouting. It is like magic. Sound quality is lovely and allows you to set it up how you like it. In short....worth every penny. If you think you can get better for less then you cant.\n"}
{"text": "1. Noise cancellation is overhyped. Its good but please do not keep very high expectations. It blocks 40 percent of the surrounding noise. 2. Sound quality is awesome. Very good bass. 3. Sound is not very loud. There should be one or two more level to increase the music volume. 3. Touch control works very well. 4. They look premium and are light weight. 5. Couldn't charge it with OnePlus 6T charger but nokia 8.1 charger worked. 6. They are not very comfortable to wear specially if you wear glasses or you have cervical problem. 7. Within 10 mins of use you can feel the sweat around your ears. Actually earpads heat up a bit while in use so you cant wear it for long in indian summer. 8. My product had a very poor battery life. It last 6 hours after full charge so definitely the battery was poor. 9. Warranty card was missing in the packet but packing was good. 10. Usb cord provided for charging is of 8 cm length only. I think it is okay. But there is no type c adaptor provided within the box. 11. Google Assistant support is awesome and useful. 12. Bluetooth connectivity is okay. 15. Sony headphone app is user friendly and a must to have. 16. Overall I don't recommend this headphone at a cost of rs 30k.\n"}
{"text": "The noise-cancelling was amazing. Stunning actually. Then, after only a week of use, the spasmodic crackling started in the right ear. (I don't blast the music to extreme levels). So the noise-cancelling turns into the sound of water stuck in your ear, such an irritating noise. I have also updated the headphones to the latest update. No change... The only good thing about these is the amazing battery life. Sadly, that now means I can get over twenty hours of irritating crackling static.\n"}
{"text": "Wow! I have never had a pair of cordless headphones and didnt realise what they were capable of in that I thought they were entirely controlled by a devise such as a tablet. To discover that you can control everything from the headphones themselves and use them for phone calls and even with voice commands via Alexa was a revelation. I had intended to buy the Bose ones as that was all I was really aware of but after researching headphones and various testimonials I purchased these as they were 60 cheaper and I am delighted. It has changed the way I listen to music as the clarity is such that you can distinguish the individual inputs of voice and instrument. I cannot fault the design of any of the components and generally they are a delight to use. Im not one to normally write a review but I am so enthused about these headphones that I felt I needed to.\n"}
{"text": "These are perfectly good headphones, but since they're a copycat product they have to be judged in comparison to the product they're copying (Bose QC35). -Noise cancelling - Winner Sony. The Bose are really good but I think the Sony's are noticeably better. - Sound quality - tie - both are very good - Bluetooth range - Winner Sony - The Sony's have a slightly more stable connection in worst-case conditions (when running a microwave nearby which is across the house from the Bluetooth connection, the Bose drop out more than the Sony's do.) - Connectivity - Winner Bose - The Bose can connect to 2 devices, they honestly don't work super well (sometimes it's not clear which ones are connected or there's some bugginess). But at least Bose is trying - Sony's only connect to one device... to switch devices you have to turn off the bluetooth on the device and manually connect to the other device which is a PITA. - Interface - Winner Bose - Lot of minor stuff. Bose has really good voice synthesis, and can pronounce your computer name. For example, I named my computer \"The Mattbook Pro\", and the Bose successfully pronounces it: \"Connected to... the Mattbook pro\". Obviously the voice isn't preprogrammed, and it's voice synthesis is surprisingly good. The Sony is okay but it just has per-recorded voice clips so it can't say the name of the device it's connected to. Next, the play/pause on the Sony is okay, and I think the touchpad gestures are pretty good/logical. But they're inconsistent, sometimes the play/pause double tap doesn't register, sometimes the track forward gesture registers as volume down, etc., etc. The discrete buttons on the Bose are better, although they're not perfect either, there's double tapping, triple tapping, etc, to control track fw/back, which are annoying to execute. - Comfort - Winner Bose - The Bose earcups are a little comfier in my opinion. - Appearance - Winner Bose - The Sony's are unnecessarily large, I think the Bose look a little nicer. The Sony's stick out farther than necessary. - Charging - Winner Sony - The Sony charges via USB-C which is nicer and more future-proof than micro USB the Bose uses. But it's not that big of a deal. Anyway, I was originally skeptical of bluetooth headsets due to their price, but if you don't have a pair I'd highly recommend buying a pair. Both the Sony's and the Bose ones are pretty good, so just get whichever one you like the best.\n"}
{"text": "So, first and foremost, the reason these didnt earn a permanent spot in my audio collection: honestly, they dont sound very good. I think theyre fine for the average person (in terms of sound at least  well get there), but if youre a bit of an audiophile, then theyre not great. The bass is very heavy, and the treble is dark and recessed. They sound hollow and boomy. They are definitely the worst-sounding headphones I own, to be honest. ...But theyre also the most expensive, which is why I have a hard time recommending them even to the average person. If you want the convenience of Bluetooth, with the life-simplifying nicety of ANC in a crowded city, and something that works well for travel, well... why not just get AirPod Pros, or something similar? Most of them cost less and honestly I think the AirPod Pros sound better. If you just want bass cannons that dont send your phone flying when you turn your head too fast, the Bose QC35s cost half what these do and have basically all the same tricks. Its true that Sonys ANC is top dog and I wont even dispute that, but... is that alone worth paying twice as much when the QC35s are more than good enough? I got these headphones and some months later, having hardly touched them at all, it dawned on me that I just didnt know what they were for. If I want comfortable cans for enjoying my music, I have that, and they sound better, and cost almost a 100 bucks less. If I want hyper-detailed critical listening headphones for really diving into a piece of music, I have that, they sound better, and they cost *200* bucks less. If I want easy, fuss-free Bluetooth travel buds, I have that. They still cost 50 bucks less even after the Apple tax. Oh, and they STILL sound better. And these days I can get a cheap Bluetooth DAC that can make my already superior wired headphones sound *even better,* while simultaneously turning it into a Bluetooth headphone. So what are these for? Not much, which is why I dont have them anymore.\n"}
{"text": "Cons: Creaky, squeaky plastic that makes noises during the slightest head movement, exactly like the WH-1000XM2 did. The touch sensor has completely stopped working after about a year. After a few months it started malfunctioning and detecting touches when there were no touches. Eventually it wouldn't detect any real touches but was constantly detecting non-touches. Around the same time, Sony released an updated Headphones app which lets you disable the touch sensor completely and so I did that. Bluetooth works with my iPhone most of the time, and has never worked properly with MacOS nor with Windows 10.  For example the volume will sometimes go to 0 on its own and when this happens the only solution is to unpair and re-pair the headphones (at which point I can see in MacOS / Windows that the volume is at 0, and increasing it then works).  The earpad material is low quality and has already started to fall apart. The design of the headphones appears to have several weak points in the plastic though I am extremely careful and have not broken them yet. These headphones are extremely overpriced for what you get: you are paying for the name brand and that's it. Positives: the battery life is good and it recharges quickly. The sound quality (disregarding the extremely annoying plastic creaking) is decent. The noise cancelling is okay for low frequency sounds, but it doesn't really cancel voices or higher frequency sounds. These headphones are fairly comfortable for long use though they are completely unventilated so these are unsuitable if you sweat. Conclusion: absolutely do not buy the WH-1000XM3. I haven't tried the XM4 but I suspect they have the same issues and maybe even new additional issues. Sony doesn't seem interesting in improving the quality so long as people keep paying these prices for garbage.\n"}
{"text": "To be honest I only got these headphones back in 2019 when I used to live with my sister and her boyfriend for a short period of time.  They are such loud and negative people that I would call these headphones my lifesaver!  With that said the noise cancellation leaves much to be desired.  I am still able to hear plenty of noise going on around me.  When it comes to comes to comfort I think these are top notch!!  I fall asleep with these headphones almost everyday for the last 2 years!!  You could have the headphones on the whole day and it wouldn't be a bother.  Battery life is ok but I feel as though it doesn't last long enough for my taste.  No worries though because if I'm too lazy to charge it (which takes 5 mins) I just use the wire that comes in the case to listen to my headphones.  It only pairs with one device at a time for people with many devices. This product is excellent for people who travel by plane often.  Overall like I said before I've had these headphones for 2 years and it has aged well I am very satisfied with this purchase.\n"}
{"text": "As someone who has mild misophonia (i.e. background noise drives me up the wall), these are seriously a life saver. It keeps me from getting distracted or annoyed by every little sound around me. I just turn on some music and I can't hear a thing around me - traffic, typing, clicking, others' music, etc. This is really important to me as I'm very sensitive to noise. The headphones have an \"optimizer\" that you can run every time you put the headphones on too, which takes a bunch of factors of your environment into account to cancel surrounding noises even more effectively. Seriously, if you're looking for real-deal noise cancellation, grab these headphones. Even if there is a newer model, they are marginally different and I can't imagine the noise cancellation could be any better than these. As far as the features that are still important, but less so, to me: the sound quality is superb as you'd expect. Great low range, very clear vocals, and overall high fidelity. These are also quite easily the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. Since I tend to wear these most of the day due to noise sensitivity, it's really nice to have a pair of headphones like these that I can wear for a solid 8 hours straight comfortably. Finally, the battery life is pretty impressive; with noise cancellation on and volume maybe 2/3 of the way up, I easily get 20 hours on a charge. They also charge very quickly - I find I can get 30-40% charge in about 5 minutes. I've owned the headphones for about 2 years now, and they still hold a charge like new even after being used for 10-12 hours almost every day. I don't know much about other brands or types of noise cancellation headphones, I just know that I'd be shocked if a better pair of noise cancelling headphones existed out there. Worth every single penny.\n"}
{"text": "I have both the Bose QC35s and these and I love the Sonys for the sound quality. However, they do have the following cons, which make me turn to the Boses more often than not: Cons: - Atrocious at handling multiple conditions. The Boses automatically maintain connections with multiple devices and as I switch between the devices, the Boses automatically switch between them. With the Sonys, I have to keep manually connecting and disconnecting the Bluetooth when I switch between my phone and laptop. - No intelligent turn off when not in use. The Boses automatically turn off when they recognize they are not being used. The Sonys supposedly have this feature, but the feature doesn't work because they will stay switched on as long as there is an active connection, not when they stop being used. This makes it so that effectively the connection is never turned off as long as your phone is on or your laptop is open. This leads to depleted batteries on my Sonys very frequently, on almost a daily basis. - Smaller con: They press on the top of my head more than my Boses, which sometimes leads to my head hurting, so I have to remind myself to keep adjusting the Sonys. Pros: - Sound quality is wonderful! Much richer and fuller sound than on the Boses. The soundstage is also much wider and it feels like the music is coming from different directions. The Boses are pretty flat in comparison.\n"}
{"text": "At first I thought these were the greatest headphones I'd ever come across. After about a year, they no longer do the most basic things headphones should do. After several hours of use, it is quite common for audio to constantly cut out and come back, I mean every few seconds you'll lose all audio and then it starts again; this can only be remedied by either using the wire connection or waiting until the next day. Upon purchase, the bluetooth range was great; now, the slightest barrier between the headphones and the device they connect to can ruin the connection, even if they're just a few feet apart. I've also come to experience a problem that lots of people have with these where the right ear muff has some strange high pitched static-like sound if the headphone volume is above a certain level (the headphones have their own volume levels if used with a PC, the volume of the headphones and the volume of the computer are separate). There seems to be no known fix for this expect turning down the volume of the headphones (12 beeps down from max volume in my case). While they're not meant for exercising, I can say that they are absolutely terrible for working out if you do happen to use them for that; they'll keep falling off, they don't handle sweat well at all, and connectivity issues might factor in. Bluetooth headphones simply aren't refined enough yet, so while these may be much better than other bluetooth headphones, that doesn't mean they're good. Wait for a couple more updated models to be released and don't buy these.\n"}
{"text": "When I first bought these headphones, they were phenomenal, best headphones i've ever owned. As someone with misophonia, having them literally changed my life, the noise cancelling was the best thing i'd ever heard. Currently, The ANC barely functions.  Within a year or so of owning these, wearing them everyday, with the noise cancelling on, they've gone from beautiful to straight up dumpster filler.  The noise quality is fine I guess, but that's not what I bought them for, what I bought them for was this supposed \"Industry Leading Noise Cancelling\" and that's not what I got. I got a pair of headphones that barely cancels out the sounds of chatter around me, and does literally nothing to anything else.  They suck. I will not be a returning customer to Sony Headphones, I'll probably even end up switching to Bose.  Y'all disappointed the hell out of me.\n"}
{"text": "I have had these headphones since June 2019 or so and am using them with iPhone, iPad and macOS, all on latest OS versions. Since a month or so ago I am also using Airpods Pro. These headphones have excellent sound isolation and battery life. Both going strong now almost a year later, despite no maintenance on ear pads (which affect isolation somewhat) and my lackluster attitude to battery health management. Airpods Pro fare worse on both of these. The ability to work unpowered came in handy a couple of times when I ran out of battery and had headphone port available. Drawbacks following. When unpowered, sound quality and isolation are very poor. iOS apps seem to want to access way more of my private information than needed, but they are not essential to use and since I dont use, say, EQ, they swiftly got deleted after the initial setup. Bluetooth support does not allow for easy switching between a trio of devices (phone, tablet, laptop)every other time I have to hold the button on the headphones to effectively turn the headphones off and enter pairing mode, the whole thing takes about half a minute. It was annoying but I got used to that at first. Airpods Pro are so much better at this. The following things, however, I cannot ever get used to:  Audible announcements and beeps are quite loud and there seems to be no way to turn them down. You can reduce the number of announcements, but the ones at startup, shutdown and low battery are impossible to turn off. (Beeps are also loud on Airpods Pro, but they are shorter and not as frequent.)  Periodically (once per week or more, so it happened way too many times already!) the headphones seem to \"lose\" sound level, which means they could suddenly play either too quiet (which is fine) or really, really loud (which makes me worry about my hearing). This does not happen with Airpods Pro, except maybe once and even then it mightve been my fault.\n"}
{"text": "Ive been using the Bose QC35s for the last two years and was excited about some of the features on the Sonys, so I decided to upgrade. I like the look of the Sony, but in the end I had to send them back. What I didnt like... The lining in the Sony touched my ears when I had them on. The touch controls are not as easy to use as the physical buttons on the Bose. The power button requires a long press to power off compared to the Bose physical switch. The noise canceling was not as good I think (compared them both on the same flight). The sound quality didnt match the Bose, the Sony sounded great, I just feel the Bose sounded better. The focus on voice feature didnt work well for me on the plane which was my main reason to upgrade to the Sonys. Pilot announcements still required me to take the headphones off to hear and I think the feature actually made it harder to hear the announcements. Putting the headphone in the case was the reverse of the Bose case. It was the reverse of how I would do it. Overall these are nice headphones for sure, but anyone looking to upgrade from their QC35s will be disappointed I think.\n"}

{"text": "Very good\n"}
{"text": "i would buy again\n"}

{"text": "for phone use, to listen to music they are a great improvement over previous headphones.\n"}
{"text": "Everything was perfect\n"}
{"text": "Nice comfort and noise cancellation, without using the eq the sound is ok but not top notch I would be nice have more metal\n"}
{"text": "Best headphone!!! I used other brands... but my experience using this model was amazing! Ok... It is not cheap... but after use this headphone you will not return to use other brands!\n"}
{"text": "Awesome product!\n"}
{"text": "Best headphones Ive ever used.\n"}
{"text": "Just a very great buy, all the boxes check out\n"}
{"text": "This product is perfect\n"}
{"text": "Bought this after much deliberation and research. The sound quality is very good, but not as open sounded as I'd like, feels like bass is over emphasized, leaving other sounds a bit closed off. Love the noise cancelation but don't like the fact that the headphones feel so closed off, making my ears very hot and uncomfortable with prolonged use. Overall, like the product but feel that it could do better with such a premium price. For comparison, I also have a pair of tribit x free tune headphones. For a fraction of the cost, they give comparable sound quality and somewhat similar comfort( they're heavier but ears don't feel hot). Only downside is they don't have any noise cancelation. Still, if music is all you want, I'd say they are way better value for money.\n"}
{"text": "BEST headphones Ive ever had. The battery life lasts forever (I can go up to a month before charging using headphones couple times a week). They are very comfortable to wear too. They completely cover the ears. The noise cancellation is awesome as well.\n"}
{"text": "I just received these headphones and I love them so far. Sound quality is excellent. Ear lobe fatigue is very light, I had them on for a solid hour and my ears feel great. Noise cancelling so far is great, couldn't hear much of anything on my commute on the train this morning. So far I'd recommend.\n"}
{"text": "What a absolutely stunning pair of headphones!  My girlfriend has a pair of Beats Solo3s, and these blow those away in terms of noise canceling and sound quality. Her Beats do last longer and look nicer though. Upgraded from the 950 extra bass headphones, and couldnt be happier.\n"}
{"text": "Not able to pair headphones with Bluetooth on lg smart tv\n"}
{"text": "Recently didn't have good luck with Sony products but these headphones are excellent so far. I have also Sennheiser and Bose noise-canceling/BT headphones but these are far better, pretty good BT range (10m+), good battery life (so far), pretty good sound quality for noise-canceling headphones.\n"}
{"text": "These are great headphones. The sound is amazing and the battery life is ridiculous. They last forever. My only complaint is they dont stay on my head very well. If I do sit ups or lay down or run they're sliding all over the place. I would say these are great for people with bigger heads or for phone who arent using them to do an active activity.\n"}
{"text": "It's probably a roll of the dice when purchasing from an unknown source like this without a warranty, I even bought a used one. It turned out to be brand new and an original product, the firmware updated perfectly and it works like a dream.\n"}
{"text": "The Good: The sound cancelling is amazing. I have trouble hearing myself when I talk with music playing. The Bad: The headphones have a touch pad that uses touch gestures for pausing, playing, vol +/-, and forward and repeat. This touch pad is not always responsive and sometimes you end up gesturing something you didn't intend to. Buttons would have been better.\n"}
{"text": "WOW! These headphones really make me smile. They bring the emotion of the music and I fell in love again with my music collection. A complete package with a rare good app that includes a great equalizer with good presets and individualpreferences, good surround options, optimizations and more. Haven't kept a Sony product for many years but I'm in love with this one.\n"}

{"text": "I would give it five stars if the ear cups were thiner with same sound quality.\n"}

{"text": "These headphones are amazing! I have only had them for a week but have been more and more impressed each day.\n"}
{"text": "The noise canceling is phenomenal. Sound quality is very good. Ive bought this for traveling in airplanes and cars. Both work perfectly. I sometimes sleep with these on, and I fall asleep in minutes. Awesome headphones. Definitely worth the price.\n"}

{"text": "I did extensive research on my headphones to be honest if youre making phone calls go with the Bose 35 but as for everything else the Sony WH 1000 xM3 rule period and I saved $100 buying from Amazon and they where brand new I ALWAYS check Amazon first\n"}
{"text": "Great sound quality, scary noise cancellation. Would be pretty close to perfection if they were able to manage more than one device at a time. Bose has that one down and Microsoft figured it out with their headset. Makes it so much more convenient to field personal and business phone calls from separate devices.\n"}

{"text": "I have used these headphones for a few hours a day over the last 7 months and have enjoyed them throughly. The \"ambient sound\" feature is also particularly helpful in an office setting when you need to hear sounds in your environment such as someone knocking on your door. Would buy again.\n"}
{"text": "Great headphones. The Mic is not that good (understandable). I would not recommendo this headset for work related matters.\n"}

{"text": "I've been on the hunt for perfect headphone for a few months. From over ear to in ear buds, these for the money far surpass anything previously tried including (Bose, jaybird, jbl and especially Beats. Beats and all apple products are junk imo. All the negative reviews you will see regarding these cans are older generation that can't figure out how to swipe or touch a sensor. Lol. Anyways if thinking too hard on what to get.... stop here and buy them. Great price through this vendor as well.\n"}
{"text": "Unbelievable noise cancellation, and not just constant hum.  Handles kids voices, banging, everything.  We had windows installed the day after I received these, and I couldn't hear them banging at all while working from home.  Allows you to connect to multiple devices at once, so you can listen to music from a computer while being connected to your phone for incoming calls. Only problem that I hope they will update by software update is that ambient noise plays back into the headphones only during calls. This \"feature\" is very distracting and defeats the whole purpose of noise cancelling headphones for noisy environments like the airport etc.  The ambient noise feature does not control this and it cannot be turned off.\n"}
{"text": "I've been eyeing Sony headphones for a while and decided to pull the trigger on these. Ended up returning them 3 weeks after getting them. These were purchases specifically for gym use, but I've determined they fit too loose on my head. Anytime I bend over, or lay flat on a bench, they want to slide of my head. Fairly annoying to constantly have to re-adjust them. Pros: Sound quality is great Noise cancelling is amazing. The battery life was great. With moderate use each week, the battery lasted 3 weeks. Range is fantastic Super comfy Cons: Fit loose on my head and always wanted to fall over, bending over or laying flat on my back while lifting weights Touch controls on the side are a little wonky\n"}
{"text": "I just received this yesterday. Still learning how to use it. Not quite sure how to use all features. So far Im very happy with sound quality. Defiantly a step up from the cheaper headphones Ive purchased in the past. Cool sound control feature by swiping up on headphone itself. Still havent taken a call. Made a couple with Siri....Im stoked to figure the rest out.\n"}
{"text": "You pay $200 for Chinese knockoffs If you arent fluent in Chinese these might be difficult to use at times Really not terrible for fake headphones, just wish I wouldve known they were fake before dishing out $200 Noise cancellation works well enough to at least block out my moms never ceasing chatter/nagging Battery lasts a long time on a full charge What is there to complain about besides not knowing when your headphones are on/off, or when noise cancellation is on/off?\n"}
{"text": "Put a lot of research into the top 5 over-the-ear headphones before buying these.  They are definitely worth it and would suggest them to anyone.  Costly?  Very much so, which isn't great...but honestly, if you're reading this, chances are you can afford it.  Love the app that goes with the headphones as well. Sound quality is great.  Hand gestures that can be used for volume, navigation and quieting the headphones is on point and very useful.  Noise cancelling works like a charm.  The ambient sound function is definitely worth it when you're in an airport waiting on your flight and/or when you need to be conscious of the people around you.\n"}
{"text": "Had high hopes for these but ended up returning them. The fit was kind of tight on my head. And the noise cancellation is incredible, but too good in my opinion. Sounds like your in like a vacuum in space, made me feel a little nauseous, it's disorienting. I ended up getting AirPod pros instead and loving them; way more portable with noise cancellation that isn't as intense.\n"}
{"text": "I'm 90% happy with these headphones. I wish they did a better job of noise cancellation. The sound quality is amazing and the battery lasts for It seems like forever! This is the first pair of noise cancellation headphones I have ever owned. I read so many reviews and did so much research before purchasing these so I expected them to perform better for that. I know that they can't cancel out all noise, so I don't feel like I am not being ridiculous. Just disappointed.\n"}
{"text": "I had read so much about these that I thought I knew what to expect. And while maybe I did, I still wasn't expecting just what a difference it would make in everyday use. I don't have to have the volume very high at all with noise cancelling turned on. And it works superbly as blocking out lower frequencies. It even blocks over 50% of the higher frequencies too. All the while it produces a great overall sound too. Glad I made the purchase.\n"}
{"text": "I bought a pair, let the wife borrow them, and found myself purchasing a 2nd pair. They are amazing. Best headphones Ive ever owned, and thats saying a lot. The google assistant and Alexa support is nice but you have to give up a button function if you want to use it. Thats my only complaint. Id rather keep the button function that allows me to toggle between modes instead of summoning one of the assistants.\n"}
{"text": "Love this product for sleeping and not being able to hear a thing at night. Especially while being deployed and sleeping near a air strip. Near lets me down\n"}
{"text": "The headphones have noise cancelation, the quality is perfect!  arrived earlier than expected! Exactly what I ordered!\n"}
{"text": "Bluetooth technology is terrible. Doesnt stay connected despite following the ridiculous app first instructions. Garbage.\n"}

{"text": "awesome Headphones, the 360 sound is really nice\n"}
{"text": "Good\n"}
{"text": "These are definitely the best set of headphones that I have ever used. I'm no audiophile, but it's got a good clean sound for music and is excellent for movies.  The Bose Quietcomfort probably has a slight edge in comfort (at least from my in-store comparison), but the XM3 is no slouch either. The headphones are pretty light, really comfortable on the ears, and the head cushioning is just right. Your ears do get a bit warm after a few hours of use, but it's definitely the only set of headphones that I've used where I could keep on my head for over an hour without having to constantly take on-and-off. I had always avoided noise-cancelling because the Bose that I tried in store gave me the \"suction\" effect that kind of messed with my equilibrium...so these are my first set of noise-cancelling headphones.  But the Sony's are really, really effective without that \"suction\" effect. The battery life is fantastic and the USB-C charge is not only fast, but ultraconvenient as most of my desktop peripherals (e.g., mouse, keyboard, phone) are also USB-C. I often prefer to plug in my headphones when I am at a desktop, so having the 3.5mm jack is also super handy. It also allows me to use the direct connection out for my digital audio converter when I am teaching live online. It is a little disappointing that it doesn't have dual bluetooth connectivity...but if that's a dealbreaker for you, then it's worth spending the money for the XM4.  The international version, as other reviews have stated, means that you don't have the U.S. warranty...so it's a bit of a risk.  But man, the price point for an upper-echelon set of headphones makes it worth the risk. My version was for the China market, so there is not Google Assistant function (replaced by the Tencent mandarin-only version)...but it's not a tool that I use. Overall, the international version is definitely worth the price if you're not willing to wait for a sale on the XM3's with the XM4's release. While I would\n"}

Cons: - Charging Cord is way too short On/off switch difficult to find and have to hold 2-3 secs to activate Hard to find the spot to answer/end phone calls Battery life only 5 hours and then it blast a warning in your ear to let you know battery is dying.....goodbye quiet If you use in bed, you are stuck lying on your back. I noticed my husband using his JBL Endurance RUN - Wired Sport In-Ear Headphones instead of this if he plans to take a long nap so he can sleep on his side as it also has noise cancellation.\n"}

{"text": "This was a big let down for me. After watching and reading all the reviews and hype, I finally got one myself, but was quickly left with disappointment. The sound quality is definitely not as good as decent wired headphones, no matter what anyone will try to say. The noise cancelling is mediocre at best. I could still hear cars on the road outside my house with the NC turned all the way up. As well as talking etc. Furthermore, for me at least, the pressure caused by the noise cancelling (and I did utilize the option to clear it in the app) means that after 30 mins i had to remove them due to the pain in my ears. After wearing these headphones for even 10 mins, my ears became uncomfortably hot and bothered, thereby negating its main intended use as a long distance travel headphone. Battery life was good though.\n"}
{"text": "Noise cancelling is about as good as it gets, not 100% but not far off. Comfortable on long flights and very adjustable. No surprise that it always tops the reviews.\n"}
{"text": "These headphones tick almost all the boxes.... Sound amazing, noise cancelling you gotta hear it to believe it. Comfortable to wear and light weight. The only downside is the in ear bell prompts, you can turn off but then you get no other notifications, they should be separate. Another plus is it does let you connect one device for calls and another for listening which is good, but not seemless like others brands if that's important to you.\n"}
{"text": "I bought a pair of these headphones - and there was a rustling the the right ear in noise cancelling mode. I loved them otherwise - so I sent them back for a refund - and another pair was purchased. After less than a week they developed the SAME PROBLEM. (this is the review i am leaving for the replacement - the first set i purchased from a different seller). It develops after longish use (~4 hours) and then persists when in noise cancelling mode. Switching them off for an extended period seems to reset the problem, meaning you have to then use noise cancelling for about 4 hours until the problem returns. The rustling is very quiet, but because you're in noise cancelling mode it is very noticeable - especially if you like to sit in silence as I do. I googled - and found it is a well documented problem. I cannot post links because it's against Amazon Rules. I don't know what to do. I love these headphones, and would consider another replacement. But now have a 2/2 failure rate. I will speak to Amazon.\n"}
{"text": "I've owned these headphones for 4 months. Everything was fine for the first 3 months, then suddenly a creaking noise started from the hinges and headband. I now know this to be a common problem. Had I known in advance I wouldn't of bothered buying them in the first place.  If you're someone on the move and like interrupted audio, don't buy these cans. I'm gutted that I wasted my money. You live and learn.\n"}
{"text": "As an old 93 aged man, I needed to get someone to set the headphones up - done by a friend - no problem. He left simple instructions for my use. They work even with hearing aids. Using with hearing aids AND reading glasses  does not help but that's not the fault of the headphones - just old age. Selected on the good rating received from Which comparison site.\n"}
{"text": "The sound qualilty of these phones is much worse than my wired phones (Grado SR 80) for one-third the price and I'd even prefer my old AKG Y50's to travel with (50).  I found the difference quite shocking. Music sounded thick, syrupy and boxed-in to the detriment of clean well seperated sound. The Sony's had more bass but it wasn't especially well defined. If you really NEED noise cancelling wireless phones then, at least according to review sites, these might be amongst the best. If you don't need those features though you'll be much better off buying wired headphones where the money goes on the sound and little else.\n"}
{"text": "These headphones are amazing, the sound at all levels is fantastic, the noise cancellation is stunning, even in a busy coffee shop environment there is little to no outside noise. However, the volume controls on the sides of the headphones are a bit awkward to use, and they seem to raise the sound sepeately from the phones sound, which can only be raised with the buttons on the side of my phone. A second issue is that the adaptive sound control can struggle on public transit. Often the train can stop and the headphones will assume that I am sitting and begin to let in the ambient sound.\n"}
{"text": "The headphones need specialist software from Google play. This can only be downloaded to android devices, I only have a work phone and am not allowed to download this to it. I did at first pair these to my laptop, the only thing I could get them to work with. There was a windows update and now they no longer pair with anything. This is a complete waste of money and there is no way you can speak to Sony technical support. This is a shame as the headpones worked well and the noise canceling is excellent. Save your money and go with a brand where you get technical support.\n"}
{"text": "These work well for watching television etc. It means if you want the volume up others dont have to hear the programme. Filters out outside noise very well. Only downside is short lead for recharging so you cant watch and recharge at the same time. Hence four stars.\n"}

{"text": "Love the noise cancellation.  Also it's a good looking head set. Love them\n"}

{"text": "I really like the build quality and material used. The noise cancellation is the best I have seen, it might be to much for some. The pressure created by active noise cancellation sometimes causes headaches for me, but everyone is different. The sound is balanced, clear and loud. The app has decent equaliser so you can adjust the sound for your needs. Battery life is very good.\n"}
{"text": "Noise cancelling is working great, build quality and comfort is also good. However Sony advertises this product with LDAC compatibility, which is working, but you can't use LDAC and eq at the same time because app doesn't let you do that. You need to choose between sound quality or ability to use eq.\n"}
{"text": "Started so well and then a crackle started in the right ear after 5 days and nothing would clear it. One you notice it you can hear it in the audio you listen too. Going back for a refund maybe Bose will be better!\n"}
{"text": "These headphones sound lovely, the sound cancelling is great too. I could listen to music in the car travelling at fast speeds and barely hear the backround noise.  Unfortunately the microphone quality was terrible and to call people I simply had to disconnect them. Connecting them to my laptop was troublesome for some reason. The band is a little loose on small heads and they don't fit snugly. Touch control is annoying and works 50% of the time.\n"}
{"text": "The sound is great, but within less than a year of purchase, the side of the headband which is made of plastic has broken from normal use. Pretty poor quality for a 250 headphones. Sony's warranty doesn't cover physical damage sadly, even though it's not my fault. Maybe my head is too big haha. I am using tape on one side to stop it from clicking open.\n"}
{"text": "My son had Bose QC35 before, he can not believe how much better the sound is on these and how comfortable. He is a very happy 17 year old :-)\n"}
{"text": "Very comfortable but don't walk away to far from your Bluetooth connection its very poor..\n"}
{"text": "So far so good, incredible sound anda confort, insane NC. Really good looking headphones, really love him. Fast delivery, no problems at all.\n"}
{"text": "Just to get this out of the way, I'd give it 4 and a half stars on noise cancelling, as they're not perfect, but I'd say they're close enough. I don't hear anything below someone banging the door down with music on, and while nothing's playing I can still hear some things but the noise is minute and if I wasn't specifically listening for it, I probably wouldn't have noticed. My brother recommended these as he said the adaptive noise cancelling kicked the s**t out of anything else in this price range. I got the headphones, and I feel as though every song I listen to, I'm listening to for the first time. The packaging was very nice, and they were charged about halfway out of the box. The zipper case it comes in seems high quality, but as I'm still a new owner, I have no comments, or obvious concerns on the durability of the headset or case. Headset came with a very short charging cable, but a charging cable nonetheless. Charges fast, battery seems to last about as advertised, but I haven't specifically timed it out.  The ability to switch to listen to ambient noise is a great feature, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase. It was a big buy for me, but I'm happy, and I have my peace.\n"}
{"text": "It was the best headphone I ever had in my life, but then, after 4 months of regular use, suddenly just stopped working. From one day to another, nothing happened! I lost my headset!!! Dont buy it! At all!!! I have a lot of Sony at home and this is the very first time Im facing a issue. The service is awful, they denied my proof of purchase, dont know why! Ill throw it out and get another brand!\n"}
{"text": "I am not the best judge of hi-fi quality sound, given that my ears are not the most trained. What I can say is this though. For some time I only bought wired headphones because I thought the better sound quality outweighed the inconvenience of being tethered. These headphones have made me rethink that logic, and I now love the freedom of being able to move around while enjoying still great sound. The software associated with the phone is the best I have personally enjoyed, and has allowed me to tune up the set to my personal liking. I love them.\n"}
{"text": "I bought these headphones for work so I can listen to music, make phone calls and reduce the background noise. These are by far the most comfortable headphones I have ever used and the sound quality is amazing. The battery life lasts a long time. I wear them about 8 hours a day and so far 2 days in a row they have about 80%. The built in headphone buttons take a little getting use to, but overall I love them.\n"}
{"text": "All I can say is that I really enjoy these headphones. They are worth the price you pay for them .... you truly do get what you pay for.... I spent more money on cheaper sets to try and find one that really works and I just should have gone for these in the first place. The ear cups are soft and fit over your ears comfortably, they are light weight , and they come with a carrying case and a cable that can be directly plugged in if you cant use Bluetooth. Would highly recommend.\n"}
{"text": "Wife loves them and so do I. These have to be the best headphones I have ever experienced . The sound cancelling technology is so good it is almost scary. Be careful when using that feature because you REALLY won't hear your surroundings. The sound quality is amazing! It FEELS even more expensive than it is. You will know why you paid what you paid for them when you use it. Plus the phone app that control it is some 'next level' stuff. Highly recommended. If I wasn't so cheap, I would buy another pair for myself. 5 stars!!!!!\n"}
{"text": "shipping was immediate and fast, thank you seller. these are my first noise cancelling headphones so i'm no expert, but they do very well eliminating low frequency noises to virtually zero. higher frequency noises like keyboard typing and glass clinking do creep in much more. i'll update once i have a chance to use on a plane. sound is very rich, and again i'm not an expert but they made some dramatic movie scenes very intense. the android app seems to work well.\n"}
{"text": "Generally, the product did met my expectations particularly for the sound quality when compared with the one-plus ear phones that I had previously.  Although the price was abit  expensive, it was worth the value. The  disappointing experiences that I have had is the short distance (30 feet) for the device to optimally and even this depends on the presence of objects around.  It is my desire for the future ... is to see the development of the blue tooth device to ensure that this  functions with speed and efficiency as opposed to developing the  'noise cancellation 'function.\n"}
{"text": "This is my first pair of noise cancellation headphones.  I used it on a couple of cross country flights.  At the end of the flight when I took off the headphones I was surprised by how much noise it had cancelled out.  Don't think I can ever go on flights without these puppies!  Haven't had any issues with the hand gestures controls and the usb-c charging is great.  Only downside is not being able to pair to 2 devices.\n"}
{"text": "At first I was loving it. The sound, the noise-cancelling, the comfort was all superior. After 2 days though I started to hear the infamous static wind noise in my right earcup. I tried every fix in the book but nothing really worked. I decided to stop worrying about it cause there's no warranty on the international version and there was nothingI could do. It did bother me a lot for while. Few weeks later I suddenly stopped hearing it, thank God. I'm now enjoying the product.\n"}
{"text": "ANC is among the best in the market. Sound quality is amazing. Battery life is alright. NOTE: this is my second pair, my first pair developed a weird popping/static in the right ear cup with ANC.\n"}
{"text": "I bought these and I love them! the sound is very nice, they are comfortable, however I have an advice for anybody thinking about purchasing any noise cancellation headphones.  They make my head hurt after 20 minutes or so of listening, it starts as an odd feeling in my ears, after a couple of songs it starts becoming into an annoying headache. My sister used them for over 3 hours and did not feel anything. Which means I'm probably a little more susceptible. Please check that you can handle the noise cancellation before purchasing.\n"}
{"text": "Noise cancelling is outstanding, they exceeded my expectations in this category. Battery life is also very good, lasting a few days of heavy use before requiring a recharge. Sound quality is good, but not quite as good as my old Sony professional headphones (MDR-7506), but then again, my old pair aren't noise cancelling. Comfort is pretty good, but my old headphones are more comfortable. The default language was Chinese, but it was easily changed using the phone app.\n"}
{"text": "The product warranty is not valid through this seller. My pair failed after a few months and I was out of luck.  I checked with Sony, Amazon and the seller.  No warranty support period.  Buyer beware.\n"}
{"text": "I was once an audio professional. I was paid to work with sound day in and day out. You wont be disappointed. Sony has headphones down better that anyone as far as I can tell. Unless you go to the $1500 dollar club, you cant do better than these absolute pieces of audio art. Enjoy.\n"}
{"text": "Excellent head phones with superb noice cancellation. But this headphone is not for conference calls during work from home era.  You will not hear the noise or disturbances in the room but other on call will hear them and tell you about noises they are hearing.  Wish the noise cancellation worked for microphone as well.\n"}
{"text": "I really enjoy these headphones. I love how well the noise cancelling makes airports and planes more tolerable. My only complaint is there doesn't appear to be a way to completely disable the ambient noise it allows in. I appreciate being able to still hear what's going on with my surroundings, but it would be nice to have the option to shut it out completely.\n"}
{"text": "Bought these a long flight to Europe.  Used them the whole time without issue.  Used them both wired and wireless on the trip.  Great noise cancelling.  Comfortable fit, not too hot.  I have an older set of Bose and these are clearly better for noise reduction and sound quality.  I would recommend them to others for sure.\n"}
{"text": "(In English below)       .   $                .          $  Eng: The headphones is absolutely amazing, I didnt face any issues with it. I saved around $100 from the one sold by amazon. The other thing, this is an international version, which from what I understood, you cannot use the warranty inside the US. Other than that, If youre looking for noise cancellation headphones, I strongly recommend this one.\n"}
{"text": "The sound suppression borders magic! The headset is lightweight, fits well and the sound quality is absolutely on the money. The iPhone app is a bit clunky but I don't really use it much, no need for that. Battery life is more than adequate. Warmly recommended!\n"}
{"text": "Definitely not what I was expecting from such a brand. Noise canceling is horrible. Upd. After couple months started scratching sound. Can't listen music anymore.\n"}
{"text": "If can 6 stars stay.  This headphones perfect sound quality  before wh 1000xm3 I used mdr xb 950 b1sound there better but bass better on mdr xb 950 b1. Why want to buy this headphones really buy. Sound great ANC working super battery life long time working. I will use this headphones for every day\n"}
{"text": "$300 headphones? Unthinkable! Until..... you listen to them.. There are a lot of headphones on the market. Few deliver. The Sony Mark III do. They get the job done. Bose comes close... Enjoy!\n"}
{"text": "The noise-canceling is amazing. The music audio is meh. The audio mic when speaking on the phone is purely awful. Returned after 1 day and two phone calls. but the v4 or Bose\n"}
{"text": "I return this product because it did not fit my head. Because of that I could not tell whether the noise canceling was working or not. I had no problem returning this product so I gave it five stars they were very good and helpful.\n"}
{"text": "I went through dozens of articles and reviews, in the end it was the WH-1000-XM3 vs Bose (QCII). I cannot consider myself an audiophile, I can say that the audio quality on these headphones is amazing. I have tried the Bose as well and besides the design - they weren't that different. What did make the difference was the battery life (30 hrs) and the Type C socket, 10 minute charge to get 5 hrs of play and the app is cool. Microphones also allowed me to have a conversation while at the airport.\n"}
{"text": "I am sure there are plenty of great headphone reviews, this is not one of them. I used these when flying and it seems like I am deaf. The hand over the ear to allow hearing is great. Battery life is great. ATL to ICN and back on one charge, Tune in and tune out the world.\n"}
{"text": "This headphone had a very loud buzzing background noise whenever I turned on the noise cancelling. The noise would get so loud that my ear would start to hurt. I had to return it. I have to say though that their sound quality is better than the noise cancelling headphone I am currently using. So if you want it for the sound it might be good but in my case, the main reason I bought the headphone was for the noise cancelling and not being able to use it for that made it useless to me. Also, the volume could be turned down lower if you are trying to read with low volume music which I liked but that buzzing windy noise was too much.\n"}
{"text": "I purchased it and I am using regularly in my life. The problem is that when I watch youtube videos after a couple of videos stop loading and I see a circle on videos. I re-installed my adobe flash and tried everything to fix. When this happens I have to restart my pc. It does not work well with pc and youtube. Other than that it is amazing.\n"}
{"text": "I have had these headphones for over 4 months now. I was happiest man alive when this headphone was working. But after a while it won't hold charge and the only way I can use these is to plug the cord to it n to my phone or laptop or anything else. I love these headphones WHEN THEY WORK! Wish I could get it when it works.\n"}
{"text": "These are the best headphones I've ever owned. Comfortable, great quality, noise cancellation works insane. Buy these now!!\n"}
{"text": "Audio quality is phenomenal, great noise cancellation even when traveling in plane you can barely hear the engine noise. Very durable design as well. Great product best among over the head headphones category and right on time Amazon thanks!\n"}
{"text": "Son muy comodos, tienen buena cancelacin de ruido, y el precio est ms econmico de lo que vala cuando sali el producto, lean la descripcin y vean videos del producto para que se informen ms, lo ame, vienen seguro en su caja y forro.\n"}
{"text": "With the headphones on, it's like being in a symphony hall.\n"}
{"text": "Way too much bass, music and sound effects sound muffled. Not what I expected from such expensive headphones.\n"}
{"text": "EQ resets to neutral if phone disconnected at all. Must relaunch app EVERY time to redo it. Also does not auto detect when it should disconnect from computer. Had to pull out computer after Id already shut laptop, and manually disconnect before it could connect to my phone.\n"}
{"text": "El producto lleg en excelentes condiciones. Suena bastante bien, tiene muy buena seal y de muy largo alcance (cero desconexiones) y el audio no presenta ningn tipo de lag o retrasa en videos. Lo nico mejorable es el material de las almohadillas, es cmodo pero luego de tenerlos puesto mucho rato debido a que no es respirable empiezas a sudar el oido.\n"}
{"text": "Nice product\n"}
{"text": "The best wireless headphones in noise cancellation, sound quality, and battery life. Sony engineering at its finest.\n"}
{"text": "I totally loved this Headset, Sony outdone themselves this time.\n"}
{"text": "Sony at their best.\n"}
{"text": "kjhj\n"}
{"text": "A very good buy Im very impressed.\n"}
{"text": "EXCELENTE PRODUCTO. NO LO PIENSEN Y COMPREN\n"}
{"text": "Everything is amazing except for after a while they begin to feel very tight on your head. Otherwise amazing headphones.\n"}
{"text": "Don't buy this if you have a small head. Most reviewers apparently are men with big heads.\n"}
{"text": "Best wireless head phones I have owned.  Great sound quality and noise cancellation.\n"}
{"text": "The best headphones I have ever had!\n"}
{"text": "Good notice canceling. Easy to use.\n"}
{"text": "I like them!\n"}
{"text": "Worth it have a such product\n"}
{"text": "I but this headphones for studies and was my best choice , excellent purchase, if u wanna buy it\n"}
{"text": "Switching between devices is tedious but very doable with a little patience. Overall the headphones are amazing and a must have for any true music connoisseur !\n"}
{"text": "Love these headphones! Sound great, the noise cancelling is awesome and the battery life is excellent! Very comfortable too!\n"}
{"text": "Utilizo este producto para trabajar y escuchar msica de vez en cuando, y es excelente. No hay quejas.\n"}
{"text": "Great headphones.\n"}
{"text": "I love it!\n"}
{"text": "Excelente equipo\n"}
{"text": "Great sound and super long battery. Clear bass\n"}
{"text": "I bought this headset for around the house and in the workshop. Overall I am very happy with it and use it almost every day. The sound profile is a little bass heavy by default which I like. When I'm using power tools the sound canceling easy brings everything down to a safe/comfortable volume.\n"}
{"text": "Feels like I am at the concert Comfortable. Google assistant works well.\n"}
{"text": "Sound quality is, in my opinion, better than bose latest competition headset, more battery life, and really fast charge 2-hour playing per 5 min charge or some, but not all is gold and shine because to have a good call quality you need to cover your mouth and refocus sound back to headset, not perfect at all\n"}
{"text": "I previously had some Bose QC's (older version) and these Sony head phones are leaps and bounds better sound quality. Would definitely recommend them. Delivery was on time and product package was in good condition.\n"}
{"text": "Best thing i have done in my life was the purchase of this headphones, end of the story.\n"}
{"text": "Everything is fine, noise cancelling and all. but there are times where the right earcup would get some sort of static, it sounds like a wind breeze and there seems like nothing could fix that issue but it only happens once or twice a week, overall I am happy with my purchase :)\n"}
{"text": "I am beyond happy that I decided to make this purchase. I will say that it does take some tinkering with the EQ settings in the app to really get the most out of these headphones. Do they drown out sound? Not completely without any music playing. If you've been questioning to get these headphones or not... DO IT!\n"}
{"text": "Ive been looking into buying these for awhile now and I can say it was worth it. Multi-device connection isnt something super important to me so I have no complaints at all, but if that is a deal breaker look into the X4s instead.\n"}
{"text": "Worked great for my son who has noise sensitivity\n"}
{"text": "Blows the new BOSE out of the water and these are my new default  audio accessory!  And buy the international version.....the PRICE is unbelievable and great value!  Make it happen kiddos!!\n"}
{"text": "I bought this headset last month. Top of the line noise cancelation and sound. After 2 weeks the right earphone emitted a faint but noticeable buzzing in when in noise cancelling. I requested a return, got it approved and sent it out. Afterwhich I purchased the MX10004. Its been almost 2 weeks and I have not recieved my refund. I've contacted the seller multiple times and get no response. Don't purchase if you expect to get a refund for a defective product.\n"}
{"text": "They are great headphones - but if you live in a state where it gets cold outside sony has not been able to fix this problem. Maybe the international versions are not meant to be used with the cold US temperatures. They will randomly like crazy go up/ down on the volume extremely fast, which is crazy.\n"}
{"text": "The headphones are amazing, noice cancellation is amazing and the sound is great. The problem I had was connecting my calls to the headphones, I would receive or make a call and it will not send them to my headphones. I had to go into the Sony app and connect them again. It was very frustrating because I would get missed calls and never get notified. Another issue what the blue tooth connection, it would take forever to connect to another device, I had to turn off all my other devices in Ofer for them to pair again. Lastly, I wanted to buy the newest version but they were just too expensive for me. I would definitely buy the XM4 to upgrade all the connectivity issues, but if you dont mind having issues with calls and Bluetooth connections then save some money and buy the XM3!\n"}
{"text": "The microphone doesn't pick up my voice for the other person to hear. Oh, it gets some of it, but very poor quality and totally unacceptable. One of the reason I bought these was to make work calls from a noisy (traffic) environment. The headphones cancel the noise great. But unusable for calls. I will return.\n"}
{"text": "Genial, un articulo que recomiendo 100%. Su material, Color, estilo, sonido.... La App para configurar... Todo supera lo esperado.\n"}
{"text": "Extremely good price compared to many sellers. Probably the best headsets Ive ever uses. Way better noises cancellations compared to Bose and Sennheisers PCX550 II as well as the newest momentum.\n"}
{"text": "I strongly not recommend to purchase anything from this store! Headphones were lost and not delviered, but store owner refused to refund and also wrote me a private email in russian, saying that I can stop trying to get refund, he will never do it. DO NOT RECOMMEND TO PUCHASE ANYTHING HERE!\n"}
{"text": "Best headphones I have ever owned. Stunning high quality build, sound, comfort and noise cancelling.  I just got them today and while I love them, I am not familiar with the touch controls on the side and not sure if I like them yet.\n"}
{"text": "They sound great.. I use them often but also at bedtine as to not disturb my wife.\n"}
{"text": "This Product is China version. China version is No Google, No Alexa. It is different from the description.\n"}
{"text": "Ive been wanting these headphones for a good year now and finally decided to buy these. The sound quality out of these are one of the best that include noise cancellation. Noise cancellation on these are the best in my opinion and is the battery life. The one fault I have with it is that the plastic on both sides (where you adjust the ear cups up, down) make this creaking noise every time I get ready to put them on my head but other then that great headphones. Just wished it wouldnt make this cheap creaking noise when I put them on my head\n"}
{"text": "I spent quiet some time reviewing over ear headphones and these kept coming up. Every review I watched had nothing but good things to say about these headphones so I decided to grab some. Keep in mind these are the first over ear head headphones I've owned. I've tried others but could never justify them and all I can say is I'm blown away by how AMAZING these headphones are. They are super light and comfortable and if you can tweak the EQ in the Sony app they open up so much more in the sound department. Do yourself a favor and buy these!\n"}
{"text": "Without music playing, I can still hear conversations if there are people next to me, but I they're much more muffled when conversations occur further. Not a problem if I play light music. These have been most useful in blocking the sound of my roommate blasting the TV and the sound of a loud air conditioning unit near me. They're also useful for commuting since the noise cancelling function can be modulated. Other sounds that aren't blocked: footsteps from upstairs, whistling Also, I was worried about these being uncomfortable based on other reviews, but as someone with smaller ears, I haven't had an issue.\n"}
{"text": "These fit large heads. I wear a size 8 hat; fully extended, they are very comfortable. The sound quality is incredible. Clear, distinct highs and mids. There's plenty of bass if you want it (use the equalizer settings to adjust how you like it), but it doesn't have the same clarity as the upper ranges, and it doesn't have any punch when it's supposed to. The touch controls are pointless, and you have to tap really hard. The setting to allow ambient noise in sucks - especially compared to the Apple Airpods Pro. The battery life if nowhere near as advertised. But overall, these are the best sounding headphones I own, and that's the biggest thing I was looking for.\n"}
{"text": "These headphones are absolutely incredible, especially at the $200 price tag I snagged them for. I had the Bose Q 35 at one point and they were good. I currently have AirPod pros but they dont work very well on an airplane for noise cancellation. The Sony headphones provide outstanding noise cancellation, beautiful  sound and the battery life is insane. Love the little touch control on the side as opposed to fumbling for buttons.\n"}
{"text": "These are the best headphones I've ever owned, and I've had a lot over the years. The noise cancelling is great, the audio quality is great, the battery lasts for a couple days under constant use, and they are comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time without making my ears sore. I use them for all kinds of stuff. Blocking out noise while I'm working, phone calls, walks on a busy street, before bed to relax, music, movies, video games, VR, podcasts. All around superb headphones. I highly recommend them.\n"}
{"text": "Have ADD/ADHD? Have your concentration broken easily? Don't need or want super-loud headphones that have to drown out voices and other sounds, possibly damaging your ears? Then these are for you. I've never experienced anything like them, to be honest. Have had my study and concentration issues largely mitigated by them after only a few days. The only drawback would be the need to reconnect every time you switch devices,...something that will improve with the XM4, supposedly. But TBH,...holding the button on the headphones for 7 seconds and simply reclicking the same headset in your other device's bluetooth settings is enormously easier with these, in comparison to any other 1-device speakers or headphones I've ever used. The reconnection NEVER fails, and you could make the argument that it makes your main connection a little more secure. The main thing is when they're on,...I don't hear anything else and as I watch the news right now, I can even hear the hosts fumbling with papers on their desks that I never really pick up. Superb buy for a superb solution.\n"}
{"text": "Almost perfect but with couple of flaws that is deal breaker: 1) Comfort - my ears starts to heats up and sweats about 15-30 minutes on. The inside foam also touches my ear lobe thus making it more uncomfortable.  2) Touch features - the volume up/down and rewind/forward gesture can be mistaken, you thought you're making straight up gesture to increase volume but if you sway a little to either right or left the headphone acted as you're rewinding or forwarding.\n"}
{"text": "Loved and wanted them ever since i tried them in a store a while go, delivery was fast in like 4 working days, which is impressive considering the current global pandemic. Pros: 1- Fantastic audio quality with great thumping bass, this is perfect for me as i was searching for bass boosted headphones, if you want a more flatter sound i would recommend the Bose QC35s. 2- Long battery life of 20+ hours as well as a quick charge via USB-C that can give you playtime of around 5 hours in like 15 minutes of charge. 3- Very comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and I tried this and the Bose QC35 which are more comfortable by just a tiny bit. 4- Comes with a very durable hard case for protection. Cons: 1- Touch controls are not ideal and can be a hit or miss, literally. Would've preferred physical buttons. 2- Can pair to multiple devices but only connect to 1 device at a time, this could be a deal breaker for some, but for my use case I connect it to my laptop, and once i want to use it on my phone, i will disconnect it from the laptop's Bluetooth settings and connect it to my phone through Bluetooth settings as well. This could be a bit of a hassle, but i've gotten used to it, but would still like there to be a fix for this one or for the future WH-1000XM4.\n"}
{"text": "Great headphones no doubt...but i bought the international version to save 50 bucks.  BEWARE if ANYTHING goes wrong with them you basically have No Warranty (unless you feel strongly about Warranties from wholesale vendors).  If i had to buy this again id go with usa version.  Short of that the headset is indeed authentic (thank god) and the headphones are fantastic.\n"}
{"text": "Can't recommend these enough. Fantastic noise cancelling, sleek design, great audio quality, no connection issues. Great noise-cancelling investment. I love the proximity pairing feature. Packed with features.\n"}
{"text": "For the price you cant get much better. These are definitely for music listeners.  If price is an issue, these go on sale a couple times a year so just wait bit and pay attention.\n"}
{"text": "These are by the best headphones ever\n"}
{"text": "They work great for noise cancellation. The sound quality and comfort on ears are definitely better than others in the market. Very pleased with this purchase!\n"}
{"text": "Noise cancelling is the best. The sound quality is on the decent level as well. Highly recommended.\n"}
{"text": "The feel is nice but I was expecting a lot better sound! I have bought 100 headphones that sound just as good if not better! Wish I could return them!\n"}
{"text": "Those headphones work very well, noise cancellation is incredible, and the battery autonomy could be work for at least two working day\n"}
{"text": "Best anc headphone with high performance\n"}
{"text": "So far so good\n"}
{"text": "Su calidad tanto en el sonido, cancelacion y comodidad son impresionantes\n"}
{"text": "It does not block sound at all\n"}
{"text": "sounds muffled\n"}
{"text": "Its very good.  More than expectation.\n"}
{"text": "Muy bueno\n"}
{"text": "Overall great. It feels lightweight, comfortable to wear, sounds great and excellent noise canceling.\n"}
{"text": "everything is the best\n"}
{"text": "I've tested both Bose NC 35 II and I rather this hp a thousand times! NC, Sound Quality...\n"}
{"text": "excellent\n"}
{"text": "Dont like the color but good headphones nonetheless\n"}
{"text": "Great sound, noise cancellation, and connectivity.\n"}
{"text": "Although Continuous background noise reduction is really good, I get only a bit of a reduction in the voice levels of my co-workers. This is far from what I expected. I would like sony to be more transparent about this. I got really frustrated when I realized that excellent background drone suppressing caused the voices to become MORE intrusive.\n"}
{"text": "This product seems good on the surface, but they want to track your location, they require their own software to use the product, they don't allow collections while charging, the charging cable is about 4 inches long. So all in all, I would NOT recommend.\n"}
{"text": "Doesn't pair with multiple devices.  Must unpair when dual booting Win10/Linux.  Bad hissing sounds.\n"}
{"text": "Wow, I can't say enough good things about these headphones. Great sound, amazing noise cancelation, super light and comfortable, long term battery life... just an amazing product.\n"}
{"text": "I am not buying this because there is absolutely zero information on the so called \"seller warrant\". All answers are evasive.\n"}
{"text": "I'm on my second pair of these headphones after only 3 months of use. Same problem with both, a scratching and popping noise from the left ear cup. It's infuriating. I'm returning and recommend no look at these, as there are multiple accounts of folks having the same issue.\n"}
{"text": "Bought this for my son, the rating I placed are from his own experience not mine. He chose this because he tried a friend's a while back.\n"}
{"text": "Hands down the best out there.  Period.  Nothing compares.\n"}
{"text": "I love these headsets! - Great quality, excellent sound (includes a customizable equalizer app), noise cancelling works awesome (with smart ambient sound). It worth every dollar spent!\n"}
{"text": "These are the best headphones Ive ever owned. You wont regret this purchase.\n"}
{"text": "The sound quality could be better but it's really good for noise cancelling headphones.  The app, controls and price were good too.\n"}
{"text": "Light enough to wear all day and a welcome change from earbuds.\n"}
{"text": "These babies have saved me from so much stress. They feel heavy on the top of my head tho, strange because theyre way lighter than youd expect. Could be the cushion\n"}
{"text": "I was getting frustrated at work with the noise level coming from chatter and laughter but this comes and saved the day. As a video editor, I needed some level of quietness to edit sound and concentrate. Best purchase ever. This came with an app to adjust settings to your perfect desire.\n"}
{"text": "Buttons are way more superior than touch controls. Hard to pause. Try to swipe up for volume and accidentally skip to next chapter or track. Stop with the gimmicks already.\n"}
{"text": "They are perfect. They sound great and last a long time. Very comfortable.\n"}
{"text": "You can't change headphones language to English. Don't buy it.\n"}
{"text": "Son espectaculares!\n"}
{"text": "The best headphones on the market! I wish it had seemless connection between Bluetooth devices\n"}
{"text": "Love it\n"}
{"text": "Im rather shocked at how good these are. Ive used them both via Bluetooth and direct wired...both sound great. For what its worth, I currently own a few high end audiophile headphones so my reference point is rather high. One of my happier purchases.\n"}
{"text": "These sound very good for Bluetooth headsets.  They are comfortable to wear and the sound is good.  I highly recommend them.\n"}
{"text": "Fantastic battery life, great noise cancelling, sound quality is only a 4 out of 5. I have own both beats studios and these, the studios have better audio but worse battery life and noise cancelling\n"}
{"text": "I used these in a noisy work environment when I need to tune out the background noise.  the sound quality is great, fits comfortably and easy to use.\n"}
{"text": "Wife loves these. Easy to det up. Sound great.\n"}
{"text": "Its what I expected from these headphones.... Ive read pretty much all the reviews before buying these and I must say, Im a happy customer..\n"}
{"text": "I have been using these headphones for a couple months now and they work very well. The noise cancelling is great for long car rides or in a loud environment. The sound quality is good for the price. The battery will last me a couple of days depending on use.\n"}
{"text": "Loved the headphones in terms of sound quality, ambiance sound control, equalizer on the sony app that works seamlessly, and of course the texture and build of the material. Noise cancellation is good but not perfect. From most reviews i could gather that the technology is not yet out for perfect cancellation in this price range. So far so great! I had an audio technica m40 earlier, this one is way lighter, comfortable and runs long on battery and easy to move around.\n"}
{"text": "Incredible sound, both high and low.  Really nice case to protect them between usage.  Pictorial directions are a bit difficult, but how hard can it really be?  Short charging cord could be longer but this does not reduce the value or rating I gave.\n"}
{"text": "I love this product so much and the reviews are true to its name, but I just dropped it from my head accidentally (which I think is not too unreasonable to do with headphones) and now the power button is dysfunctional. Headphones do not turn on at all, even with a full charge.  It seems I can't return it so now after less than two months I have another dysfunctional pair of Sony headphones.\n"}
{"text": "I have Bose QC 35 II and Sony WH-1000XM3, both are great headphones. But personally I like XM3 more then QC 35 II, XM3 got better noise cancelling and bass.\n"}
{"text": "I have been using this headphones for over 2 months everyday  and they are working perfectly. The battery lasts me for at least 4-5 days, so I use them about 5-6 hours a day. Very comfortable. The shipment was really fast and it came in the original package. Fast charging is great and is easy to change them between 2 devices. Once you try to pair a third device the Headphones will require for you to set them into pairing mode and that could take sometime if you don't know how to.\n"}
{"text": "Some very nice upgrades over the prior model, which I owned for over a year at this point. Initial thoughts: - Better sound cancelation. - Construction appears to be more solid and put together. - Improved case: place to store aux cable. Overall: these are arguably one of the best sound cancelling headphones money can buy; take it from someone who relies on these things to get anything done at work. BTW dont worry about the international edition, no issues here and I cant imagine the other variations being packaged or presented differently, so why not save some $$$.\n"}
{"text": "The sound quality is unparalleled. I'm pleasantly surprised that these are so well-designed and easy to use. I don't have any complaints, although an observation is that the instructions seem not to have been written by a native English speaker, which didn't matter really because there were very easy-to-understand graphics that made everything clear.\n"}
{"text": "Sound quality, comfort and noise canceling are very good. I just don't understand why there is no way to mute the mic on the headphones. Hopefully this can be added by a firmware update at some point.\n"}
{"text": "Very weak bass, and doesn't perform for the price. And the over the ear pads were wrinkled like they were used. Thinking of returning product.\n"}
{"text": "I bought this item and used it for one full charge and then I recharged it. After that it would not work, it would not pair, it would not playing music and just made a static sound.  My biggest regret is that I missed the return window.  Ive since to spot a pod pros\n"}
{"text": "Great headphones and amazing noise cancellation, but I would buy from an authorized dealer with a US warranty. I bought these headphones a little over a year ago and now about 30 days outside of the warranty period they fail to turn on. It seems like it's a common issue with the 1000XM3 headphones. There goes $200 :(\n"}
{"text": "These headphones have deep rich sounds. I use mine for watching movies. I also use for paid premium apps for the great sound quality. Great purchase.\n"}
{"text": "I use this twice a week for zoom meetings.  Very happy with sound quality.  Cheaper from Amazon then other brick and mortar store.\n"}
{"text": "I think, that is a good quality headphones for this price. Not professional, but it is good and confortable\n"}
{"text": "I love it\n"}
{"text": "Overall a good headset for the price point.\n"}
{"text": "\n"}
{"text": "Excelente calidad\n"}
{"text": "Really good headphones\n"}
{"text": "Fantastic product as they described exactly and even better in addition, his application so helpful and it's designed realy good\n"}
{"text": "Battery will last for 30h. This is a big lie.\n"}
{"text": "overall it's an amazing headset, little bit of a creak on the left cup. but it's a minor isssue\n"}
{"text": "They're good\n"}
{"text": "Excellent noise canceling\n"}
{"text": "Es todo lo que promete, es lo mejor que he probado hasta ahora\n"}
{"text": "I really like it so much, the sound quality is so good.\n"}
{"text": "The product is good but the seller is untrusted\n"}
{"text": "It is a good one for exercising.\n"}
{"text": "This came very quick! Thanks!\n"}
{"text": "Better than other noise cancelling earbuds and headphones I have had\n"}
{"text": "Got a new headphone last week, fine with the Chinese instructions only, tried 1 day, everything was perfect. There was around20% battery i remember. But the 2nd day run out battery when i try to turn it on. And NOT chargeable at all tried both. Then i submit return this headphone, tried Bose Q 35II, 700 And tried Sony Wh910n. So sad that i have to go back with XM3, because XM3 does work the best on noise cancelling. I'm going to try this seller one more only, after a few search, i found out this is the only one fulfilled by Amazon. Update on 6/17, trust me! Do buy it, I tried and bought twice from this seller. The 2nd Headphone start extremely large electronic noise from left side suddenly while I'm listening music. Very disappointed because I cannot return it or replace it because it has been 1.5 months after I'm buying it.  I actually only used twice for more 1 hour. 1st time is on a airplane about 2 weeks ago, 2nd time is now on a high speed train, i have been using it for 1 hour and the terrible noise suddenly came out.\n"}
{"text": "I have had my headphones for exactly a year, and I have always kept them in their case. but right at the year mark one of the panels that lets it extends cracked and pops off multiple times a day.\n"}
{"text": "To spend $260 on headphones that only work for 8 months.  I would not buy again.  Let's hope the warranty does something....warranty will replace them once with refurbished headphones.  Lets hope these last\n"}
{"text": "Bought these for my 19-year-old daughter for her birthday. Did a ton of research and opted to go with these. Glad I did. Noise canceling features  truly are that good. Comfort is beyond belief. She wears the most of the time, but when Ive worn them, I see all the hype from articles Ive read about the.  I cant believe the quality of these headphones.\n"}
{"text": "So compared to my friends his felt alot durable and sturdy mine felt light so if you want a pair for a cheaper price point this would be your choice but be warned something may inevitably be damaged wanted to buy an authentic pair but decided to wait until the xm4 come out\n"}
{"text": "Damn, these are awesome! Had Bose AE2 soundlinks for about a year then I put these on and said \"holy crap\". Definitely the best headphones I've ever worn! The only complaint I have is when you want to use the noise cancelling and all the cool features with the wire, when you place your right hand over the right ear cup the ambient sound is a bit glitchy. Other then that, amazing!\n"}
{"text": "The music audio is just okay, but the noise cancelling is top notch. Makes plane rides a lot more enjoyable. Also, great battery life and it doesn't require you to use the app, unlike the Bose version.\n"}
{"text": "All of the written directions and the voice prompts on the headphones are in Japanese (I assume since I don't know Japanese). I may be able to change the prompts in Sony's app. I haven't looked. Other than that, the headphones are great. Sound great!\n"}
{"text": "bought this new about 2 months ago, they work very well, great sound quality, good noise cancelling, extremely comfortable, battery is good about 3 full days between school, tv, games, music with noise cancelling. Not much to complain about, noise cancelling might be a bit over exaggerated in some of the review but is still good definitely recommend this headphone\n"}
{"text": "I get around 35-40 hours with noise cancelling on. The noise cancellation is great and the ability to change the sound stages through the app is amazing. Best headphones Ive ever purchased.\n"}
{"text": "I love these headphones so far. So their new so I'll update in 6 months. The only thing I don't like at this time when I move or stop moving the headphones seems to adjust and the sound abruptly cuts off momentarily. But maybe that's a setting I can adjust.\n"}
{"text": "Outstanding sound, outstanding noise cancellation, very comfortable, I do think music controlling, next song, precious song, increasing and lowering volume is not as easy to use.\n"}
{"text": "Love these!! Im a light sleeper and got them to drown out noise. I select rain noises and have that playing.  All other noises are drowned out even my husband talking right next to me.\n"}
